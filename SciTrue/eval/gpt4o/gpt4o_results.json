      "summary": "The impact of school uniforms on bullying and misbehavior is a subject of ongoing debate, with studies yielding mixed results. A study by Attillah N. Brookshire found that teachers perceived a school with uniforms to have a significantly better climate, including reduced bullying, compared to a non-uniform school. ([scholarworks.waldenu.edu](https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/dissertations/2249/?utm_source=openai)) Conversely, research by Arya Ansari and colleagues indicated that school uniforms did not lead to improvements in student behavior or attendance, and students reported a lower sense of school belonging. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35068671/?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, a study highlighted by ScienceDaily reported no significant effect of uniforms on young students' behavior or attendance. ([sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/12/211220120703.htm?utm_source=openai)) An article in The Conversation noted that while some studies show a reduction in misbehavior with uniforms, others report increased suspensions or no significant change. ([theconversation.com](https://theconversation.com/does-wearing-a-school-uniform-improve-student-behavior-51553?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, a study cited by the California Learning Resource Network suggested that uniforms can reduce social divisions and bullying by eliminating emphasis on clothing. ([clrn.org](https://www.clrn.org/does-school-uniforms-reduce-bullying/?utm_source=openai)) Overall, the evidence is inconclusive, with some studies indicating potential benefits of school uniforms in reducing bullying and misbehavior, while others find no significant impact or even negative effects.",
