Some argue that affirmative action leads to the admission of students with lower academic credentials, potentially compromising academic standards. For instance, a study by Peter Arcidiacono suggests that affirmative action may result in a mismatch between students' academic preparation and the institutions they attend, potentially leading to lower performance and higher dropout rates. However, other research challenges this view. A study by Fischer and Massey found no evidence supporting the mismatch hypothesis; instead, they observed that students admitted through affirmative action performed comparably to their peers. Additionally, the implementation of Proposition 209 in California, which banned affirmative action, led to a significant drop in minority enrollment at selective universities, suggesting that affirmative action plays a crucial role in maintaining diversity without necessarily lowering academic standards. Furthermore, research indicates that standardized test scores, often used as measures of academic merit, can be influenced by socioeconomic factors, implying that affirmative action helps address these disparities.

(2020) found a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust, particularly at the neighborhood level, with the effect being more pronounced for trust in neighbors and when diversity is measured locally. ([annualreviews.org](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/polisci/23/1/annurev-polisci-052918-020708.pdf?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, van der Meer and Tolsma (2014) observed consistent support for the 'constrict' claim, noting that ethnic diversity negatively impacts social cohesion in spatially bounded areas like neighborhoods, with stronger effects in the United States compared to other countries. ([annualreviews.org](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309?utm_source=openai)) However, McKenna et al.

([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5875770/?utm_source=openai)) Laurence and Bentley (2016) provided longitudinal evidence supporting a causal relationship between increased ethnic diversity and reduced social cohesion, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying mechanisms.

([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-9477.12127?utm_source=openai)) These findings collectively suggest that while ethnic diversity can challenge social cohesion, especially at the local level, the effects are influenced by factors such as intergroup contact, perceived threat, and the specific dimensions of social cohesion considered.",

Despite these measures, the effectiveness of buffer pools has been debated, especially as climate change increases the frequency of natural disturbances. Additionally, the concept of 'tonne-year accounting' has been proposed to better assess the temporal value of carbon storage in forests, acknowledging that while forests can sequester carbon, their storage is not necessarily permanent.
