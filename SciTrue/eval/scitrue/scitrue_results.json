                "paragraph": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is an amino acid, the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is a white crystalline salt that produces a palatable taste referred to as \"umami\" [1,2]. MSG was first identified by Kikunae Ikeda as a taste enhancer in 1908 at Tokyo Imperial University where it was extracted from Lamineria japonica a sea weed [1]. At present it is commonly utilize in the production of most food seasonings to enhance taste. Glutamate has been reported to function in some biological processes, such as syntheses of neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid, nitric oxide), folic acid, collagen and glutathione [3]. MSG is used by glutamate receptors in nerve terminals, brain, spinal cord, conducting system, kidney, liver, testes, lungs, spleen and heart [4]. \n\nThe estimated daily consumption of MSG is 0.55g/day [5]. However, due to increased consumption of processed foods with MSG, the daily intake in most developed and developing countries could rise as high as 3-4g/day [6]. Regular consumption of high amount of MSG was proven to be harmful in both animal and human trials [4,7]. At present the safety of MSG consumption is questionable. Previous report has shown that monosodium glutamate have deteriorating effect on some organs and it disrupt cell functions which could lead to several health disorders [8]. It has been implicated in obesity [7], diabetics, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity [8]. MSG toxicity is fast becoming a major cause of concern due to its uprising consumption and demand hence the need to investigate palliative therapies that could obstruct and ameliorate MSG stimulated pathological processes.",

This study investigated the effect of consumption of MSG and treatment with graded doses of omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3). Forty-eight male Wistar rats (n=8) grouped into six; control, MSG, MSG + Low dose of ω-3 (LD ω-3); MSG + High dose of ω-3 (HD ω-3), LD ω-3, and HD ω-3 were used for this study. MSG was administered at 4 g/L/day in their drinking water for 6 weeks, while ω-3 was administered at low and high doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg BW, p.o. respectively for 4 weeks. Results revealed that administration of MSG induced imbalance in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and hepatic dysfunction. These were revealed by significant decreases in TG, HDL-C, CAT, GSH, albumin and total protein; but, significant increases in LDL-C, MDA, AST, ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin (TB), compared to control group. Administration of graded doses of ω-3 following treatment with MSG was characterized with significant reductions in ALT, ALP, TB and MDA. The administration of ω-3 showed no effects on the antioxidant indices. Conclusively, LD ω-3 is a potent ameliorative supplement which can be administered after pre-exposure to MSG.",

This review focused on recent studies of the association of HPD with long-term kidney health and the concept of high dietary protein-related nephropathy. Recent findings Several long-term observational studies including large populations have reinforced the notion that HPDs are associated with a rapid decline of kidney function. An increase in renal blood flow and glomerular hyperfiltration caused by vasodilation, and increased levels of endocrine and paracrine factors (glucagon, IGF-1, prostanoids, and nitric oxide), facilitates the excretion of protein-derived nitrogenous waste. Inhibition of tubule-glomerular feedback and increased proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption after a HPD augment glomerular hyperfiltration and may trigger synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis reported in association with anabolic steroid may indeed be a HPD nephropathy given that HPD results in progressive glomerulosclerosis, especially in remnant glomeruli or in diabetic kidney disease but can happen in any high-risk situation, such as solitary kidney and polycystic kidneys. Summary HPD among athletes and bodybuilders in an extreme way across a long-term period may pose a risk to renal health including high incidence of HPD nephropathy.",

                "paragraph": "Protein intake is one of the most widely discussed issues in the nutritional management of CKD. A high-protein diet, defined as intake of > 1.2 g protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day), has been shown to cause significant deterioration in kidney function [11]. High protein intake increases kidney blood flow and elevates intraglomerular pressure, which leads to higher GFR and more efficient excretion of protein-derived nitrogen products. The hyperfiltration induced by high protein intake has been described in several experimental models and clinical studies [12][13][14][15][16]. High-protein diet-induced glomerular hyperfiltration may have deleterious consequences on the kidney and other organs in the long term [11]. Several studies have shown that long-term exposure to a high-protein diet may cause kidney damage and progressive kidney dysfunction [17,18]. The Nurses' Health Study evaluated the effects of protein intake on estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFR cr ) decline in 1,624 women over 11 years [17]. The results showed that high protein intake was associated with an eGFR cr decline among individuals with decreased kidney function (defined as eGFR cr of 55 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) but not in those with normal kidney function. Recently, Jhee et al. [18] reported that a high-protein diet induced glomerular hyperfiltration and a rapid decline of kidney function in the general population. A high-protein diet increased the risk of kidney hyperfiltration and a rapid decline of kidney function in the general population. While the effects of a high-protein diet in individuals with normal kidney function are controversial, high protein intake should be avoided in patients with CKD or risk of CKD [16,17]. \n\nDietary protein intake has increased to above the recommended level in the general population in Korea over the past 20 years [19,20]. According to the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data in 2017 [19], the mean dietary protein intake was 153% of the recommended intake in men and 128% in women among the general population in Korea.",

                "abstract": "The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing with the aging of populations worldwide. As kidney function declines, the accumulation of metabolic waste products and excessive electrolytes can significantly impair the health of patients with CKD. As nutritional management of patients with CKD is thought to control uremic symptoms and provide beneficial effects on the progression of kidney dysfunction, the diet of patients with CKD should be an important consideration in their care. Many guidelines recommend limiting protein intake in these patients, as high-protein diets aggravate kidney dysfunction. Excess sodium may be associated with CKD progression and all-cause mortality and, therefore, limiting salt intake is generally recommended. Low potassium is associated with muscle weakness and hypertension, whereas high potassium is associated with cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, recent guidelines recommend adjusting dietary potassium intake on an individual basis to maintain serum potassium levels within the normal range. Appropriate dietary calcium intake is recommended to maintain calcium balance in patients with CKD G3, G4. Given the many dietary considerations for patients with CKD, effective nutritional management is challenging. Individualized strategies are needed to ensure the best outcome for patients with CKD.",

                "paragraph": "Since a growing population can be classi ed as overweight or obese, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein (HP) diet has recently emerged to be popular for weight loss [1]. Even in patients with Type 2 diabetics (T2D), HP diets have been demonstrated to induce reduction in appetite and improvement in outcomes and have been recommended as a medical nutrition therapy in some guidelines [2]. The International Society of Sports Nutrition states that the daily intake of 1.4-2.0g/kg protein for physical activity may improve the adaptability of training to exercise training, and provides new evidence that higher protein intake (>3.0g/kg/d) may promote the loss of fat mass and the building of muscle mass in resistance-trained individuals [3]. Therefore, such diets have recently gained increasing attention. However, the potential effects of HP regimes on the parameters of kidney health for individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD; glomerular ltration rate [GFR] < 60mL/min) are still controversial. \n\nThe recommended daily amount of protein for the general population is 0.83g/kg, which is su cient to avoid negative nitrogen balance and meet 97% − 98% of the population's requirements. Although the consensus de nition of an HP diet remains unclear, most de nitions had set thresholds of 1.2 g/kg to 2.0 g/kg per day [1]. High intake of dietary protein, including animal and plant protein, may accelerate the loss of kidney function for patients with CKD or at risk of CKD (e.g., patients with diabetes or obese patients with microalbuminuria). A body of evidence has suggested that an HP regime leads to an increase in GFR and triggers renal glomerular hyper ltration, which results in renal damage [4]. In animal studies, HP diets have been associated with increased blood ow to the kidneys, a deterioration of renal injury, increased albuminuria, and histopathological changes in the kidneys [5]. \n\nHuman data have also revealed hyper ltration with HP consumption.",

However, the potential effects of HP regimens on kidney health for persons without chronic kidney disease (CKD) are still controversial. MethodsTo investigate the effects of HP diets versus standard protein/low protein (SP/LP) ones on renal function in individuals without CKD, we conducted this meta-analysis. ResultsThirty-nine RCTs including 3400 participants were considered in this meta-analysis. HP diets resulted in an increased GFR (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 1.26) and concentrations of serum urea (MD = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.44), creatinine (MD = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.30, 4.58), and uric acid (MD = 19.89, 95% CI: 12.35, 27.43) in obese subjects when compared with SP/LP diets. The results in T2D and health participants did not show a notable detrimental effect on renal outcomes. Subgroup analysis showed that an increase in GFR was presented in obese subjects following an intervention shorter than 6 months. No significant differences were found in the urinary albumin excretion between the HP and SP/LP diets in obese and T2D populations, except for the healthy participants which was reported by only one study.Conclusions﻿This meta-analysis showed that HP diets were associated with increased GFR, serum urea, creatinine, and uric acid in obese adults. Future studies are warranted to examine whether resulted glomerular hyperfiltration from HP diet can cause kidney damage in obese individuals.",

A randomized comparison of the effects of high and low protein diets on renal function in obese individuals suggested that high protein diets did not present a health concern with regard to renal function their study population [65]. In this study, 65 overweight, but otherwise healthy, subjects adhered to a low or high protein diet for six months. In the high protein group, both kidney size and GFR were significantly increased from that measured at baseline. No changes in albumin excretion were noted for either group and the authors concluded that, despite acute changes in renal function and size, high protein intake did not have detrimental effects on renal function in healthy individuals. Similar findings were recently reported by Boden et al. [88] in a study of 10 subjects who consumed their typical diet for 7 days followed by strict adherence to a high protein diet for 14 days. No significant changes were noted in serum or urinary creatinine and albumin excretion, suggesting no ill-effects of a high protein diet on renal function. \n\nAthletes, particularly in sports requiring strength and power, consume high levels of dietary protein [89,90]. In fact, many athletes habitually consume protein in excess of 2.0 g/kg/day [91]. Supplementation with amino acids will further increase dietary protein levels in these individuals [92]. Yet there is no evidence that this population is at greater risk for kidney disease or losses in renal function [90]. Poortsmans and Dellalieux [93] found that protein intakes in the range of ~1.4-1.9 g/kg/day or 170-243% of the recommended dietary allowance did not impair renal function in a group of 37 athletes.

As a result, the safety of habitually consuming dietary protein in excess of recommended intakes has been questioned. In particular, there is concern that high protein intake may promote renal damage by chronically increasing glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration. There is, however, a serious question as to whether there is significant evidence to support this relationship in healthy individuals. In fact, some studies suggest that hyperfiltration, the purported mechanism for renal damage, is a normal adaptative mechanism that occurs in response to several physiological conditions. This paper reviews the available evidence that increased dietary protein intake is a health concern in terms of the potential to initiate or promote renal disease. While protein restriction may be appropriate for treatment of existing kidney disease, we find no significant evidence for a detrimental effect of high protein intakes on kidney function in healthy persons after centuries of a high protein Western diet.",

Moreover, while brown sugar is more natural and does not undergo refinement steps and addition of chemicals, making it probably nutritionally richer, the difference may not be substantial enough to consider it significantly healthier (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:89907381'>Curi et al., 2017</a>). Additionally, the glycemic indexes of white coconut water sugar are 2 to 3 times lower than that of brown sugar, indicating that brown sugar may not be the healthiest option available (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:92569669'>Anselme et al., 2018</a>).",

The contents of the taste compounds in sample AB was higher than in sample AW and lower than in sample AL. Sample AB had the strongest “umami” and “full-body” taste and the highest response values for the UMS and GPS sensors. Combined with the PLSR results, brown sugar could be used to balance the taste of chicken seasoning. In conclusion, brown sugar had a positive effect on flavor quality and could help to improve chicken seasoning recipes.",

                "paragraph": "Consumers are increasingly concerned about health and thus interest in the consumption of healthier foods is increasing. Within this context a demand has emerged for replacing the traditional white cane sugar by more natural and probably healthier sugars (Struck et al., 2014). The substitution of the type of sugar is associated with significant changes in texture, color, flavor and shelf life (Souza et al., 2013), so it is a challenge to find suitable replacements which result in satisfactory products (Riedel et al., 2015). \n\nSugar is an essential component in the elaboration of products such as preserves, jams and jellies and sucrose is normally used in its white refined or crystal form (Jackix, 1988). However, to obtain white sugar, especially during the extracting and refining stages, some additives are added such as clarifier agents and preservatives that remain, at least in part, in the products to which they are added and depreciate the nutritional quality (Mendonça et al., 2000). The white crystal sugar is composed of large, transparent or slightly yellow crystals. After extraction of sugarcane juice, purification, evaporation and crystallization, this sugar undergoes a slight refinement stage where it loses many of its minerals. By being economical and 'going a long way' , white crystal is one of the most used sugars (Rodrigues et al., 1998). White refined sugar is obtained from the purification of white crystal sugar. It features fine, irregular grains which easily dissolve in beverages and other preparations. In refining, chemical additives, such as sulfur, are used to give a whiter color to the sugar. \n\nThe demerara and brown sugars, extracted from sugarcane, would be two sugar options that are more natural than the traditional white sugar. As they practically do not undergo refinement steps and addition of chemicals, they are probably nutritionally richer sugars having a chemical composition very similar to sugarcane juice. Brown sugar is a raw sugar, dark and moist, a type of unrefined sugar with a strong molasses flavor produced by dehydrating sugarcane juice (Asikin et al., 2014).",

In addition, we evaluated the influence of the information on the acceptability of the product. It was found that the type of sugar greatly influences the physicochemical and rheological characteristics of physalis jelly which reflects differences in the product acceptability. Due to higher sensory acceptance, white refined, white crystal and demerara sugars are the most suitable for processing jellies. It was also found that the sugar type information and its benefits has no significant influence on sensory acceptance of physalis jelly and that consumers have a preference for a clearer, less sweet, more acidic and softer jelly.

                "paragraph": "The environmental impact of electric vehicles (EVs) has become a central topic in discussions surrounding sustainable transportation solutions. As the world grapples with the pressing need to reduce carbon emissions, air pollution, and dependence on fossil fuels, EVs have emerged as a promising alternative with the potential to mitigate these environmental challenges [31] . This article delves into the various dimensions of the environmental impact of EVs, exploring their benefits, considerations, and overall contribution to a greener future. One of the most significant environmental benefits of EVs lies in their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike internal combustion engine vehicles that rely on fossil fuels, EVs are powered by electricity, which can be generated from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. When charged with clean energy, EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, leading to a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change [32] . \n\nFurthermore, EVs are inherently more energy-efficient than traditional vehicles. Electric motors are more efficient in converting energy from the grid to motion than internal combustion engines, which experience energy losses through heat and friction. This efficiency translates into a lower overall energy consumption for EVs, making them a crucial tool in achieving energy conservation and reducing overall resource consumption. Air quality improvement is another notable advantage of EVs. Internal combustion engine vehicles emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to air pollution and adverse health effects. EVs, being emission-free at the tailpipe, contribute significantly to reducing local air pollution and improving urban air quality, particularly in densely populated areas [33] . However, it's important to acknowledge that the environmental impact of EVs is influenced by factors beyond their tailpipe emissions. The life cycle assessment of EVs takes into account the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, including manufacturing, operation, and disposal. The production of EVs involves the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing processes, and the energy required to produce batteries, which can have environmental implications. Nonetheless, as battery technology improves and recycling processes develop, the overall environmental footprint of EV manufacturing is expected to decrease [34] . The proliferation of EVs also poses challenges related to the demand on electricity grids.",

Significant emphasis has also been placed on the use of batteries in electric vehicles (BEV), which are now treated as a real factor in environmental protection as they reduce the use of fossil fuels [16]. For this reason, currently, the most frequently presented studies in the literature are those comparing the ecological profiles of vehicles with various driving technologies, such as the comparison of internal combustion engine cars with purely electric and hybrid cars [17,18]. The fuel consumption and emissions of electric and hybrid vehicles have also been studied from the perspective of the life cycle analysis [19][20][21][22]. The aim of this research was to show that electric mobility plays a particularly important role in the sustainable development of road transport. Often, however, comparative studies limited to local conditions have been carried out. \n\nMany studies have focused only on specific elements of the vehicle, such as the battery [23][24][25], but this information is scarce and it is based on materials available in the literature. \n\nSeveral studies have assessed the impact on the environment of elements other than the drive unit of the vehicle. They included the material input for the entire vehicle, and on this basis, analyses were made throughout the entire life cycle, including the operation phase [26][27][28]. In these studies, the inventory data contained in the literature have often been used, and on this basis, the environmental impact of the car has been assessed. In addition, the most frequently studied phase has been the vehicle production phase, mainly regarding the production of the powertrain. A comparison of the environmental profiles of conventional and electric cars is also presented in [29][30][31][32].

Currently, assessment of the ecological properties of vehicles is based on various criteria. In the case of combustion-powered cars, most attention is usually paid to the values characterizing their use, and in terms of environmental assessment, pollutant emissions, and operational fuel consumption are key factors. The current article considers the possibility of using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to analyze the ecological properties of a passenger car during its operation. A simplified LCA method for vehicles, which, in strictly defined cases, can be used for the analysis of environmental impact and assessment of the energy analysis related to its operation, is presented. For this purpose, a vehicle life cycle model is developed. Data on the operation of 33 passenger cars from different manufacturers with similar operational characteristics, coming from different production periods, are analyzed in detail. The vehicle use model takes into account the environmental load due to fuel consumption and pollutant emissions from the internal combustion engine, as well as processes related to the maintenance of the car. The obtained results show that, from the point of view of a car’s impact on the environment throughout its life cycle, the phase of its operation plays the most important role. For the annual operation period, the results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that, in the assessment of energy inputs and related emissions throughout the life cycle of a passenger car, the mileage of the car, which is determined by both the periodicity of replacement of elements and materials subject to normal wear and the length of the adopted period, is of key importance. For the tested vehicles, both the energy input resulting from fuel consumption as well as CO2 and SO2 emissions constitute about 94% to 96% of the total input during the annual operation of the vehicle.",

                "paragraph": "In this section, different environmental benefits of vehicle electrification are assessed. EVs make the environment sustainable by reducing fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions. By electrifying transportation and integrating renewable energy resources into the electricity grid, China is aiming to reverse the rising trajectory of CO2 emissions by 2030 [134]. GHG emissions objective is used as a benchmark to find the EV expansion and renewable energy integration to achieve this goal in [135]. Here, an electricity supply and emission model is presented to forecast the intensity factors of GHG under different renewable energy generation scenarios. It shows that the high efficiency of EVs reduces GHG emissions and energy demand. More EVs and electricity generation from renewable are needed to nullify the rising trajectory of CO2 emissions. In [136], the electric vehicle operation from the viewpoint of the environmental impact of electric power generation from different primary power production sources is studied. It is shown that differences in the effectiveness of the conversion of mixed forms of energy into electricity and their share in this process directly affect the final level of GHG production and the ecological footprint of electric vehicle operations. As a result, in [137], a model is implemented that charges the EVs using Photovoltaic (PV) farm generation to obtain zero-emission transportation. \n\nA case study that models electric power systems to assess the variation in generation emissions by integrating EVs into the Texas grid is presented in [138]. The results indicate that the generator efficiency increases significantly when there is flexibility in vehicle charging. During the ozone period, the change in generator dispatch results in a decrease in generator NOx emissions. V2G services including energy storage and spinning reserves lead to a sufficient reduction in SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions. The trend of decrease in CO2 emissions due to EVs and vehicle miles traveled from 1990 to 2020 is shown in Figure 2. EVs are incorporated into the transportation network starting in 2010 and their quantity increases sharply. The increase in the number of EVs leads to a decrease in CO2 emissions. A life cycle evaluation of EVs, internal combustion EVs (ICEVs), HEVs, and their impact on the environment based on energy consumption is presented in [139].",

                "abstract": "Transportation electrification is a pivotal factor in accelerating the transition to sustainable energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) can operate either as loads or distributed power resources in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) linkage. This paper reviews the status quo and the implications of transportation electrification in regard to environmental benefits, consumer side impacts, battery technologies, sustainability of batteries, technology trends, utility side impacts, self-driving technologies, and socio-economic benefits. These are crucial subject matters that have not received appropriate research focus in the relevant literature and this review paper aims to explore them. Our findings suggest that transitioning toward cleaner sources of electricity generation should be considered along with transportation electrification. In addition, the lower cost of EV ownership is correlated with higher EV adoption and increased social justice. It is also found that EVs suffer from a higher mile-per-hour charging rate than conventional vehicles, which is an open technological challenge. Literature indicates that electric vehicle penetration will not affect the power grid in short term but charging management is required for higher vehicle penetration in the long-term scenario. The bi-directional power flow in a V2G linkage enhances the efficiency, security, reliability, scalability, and sustainability of the electricity grid. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging/discharging has also been found to be effective to offload the distribution system in presence of high EV loads.",

Before the year 2000, renewable energy was almost non-existent in mining operations. However, there was a sharp increase in such projects by 2019, with the capacity of installed renewable systems growing from 42 MW per year in 2008 to 3397 MW in 2019. Notably, the majority of the installations in 2018 and 2019 consisted of hybrid systems. These systems combine multiple technologies such as wind, solar, and energy storage, and are often supported by fossil fuels to mitigate the inconsistency of renewable energy production. The authors also explain that despite the financial appeal of reduced costs for wind and solar PV technologies, the adoption of renewable energy within mining remains limited, challenged by operational and technical complexities, yet integrating renewable energy-through increased energy efficiency, energy recovery, and direct use in electric, transportation, and thermal needs-presents a viable path to reduce carbon emissions and harness cost savings. The authors further explain that the feasibility of integrating renewables varies significantly with the mine's location, development stage, and whether it relies on external power or self-generation. Despite obstacles, strategic alliances between the mining and energy sectors, capacity building, information sharing, supportive government policies, and expanded research and development could facilitate a broader adoption of renewable energy, advancing the sector towards sustainability.",

This review examines the environmental impacts associated with the production, use, and end-of-life management of SSBs, starting with the extraction and processing of raw materials, and highlights significant natural resource consumption, energy use, and emissions. A comparative analysis with traditional battery manufacturing underscores the environmental hazards of novel materials specific to SSBs. The review also assesses the operational environmental impact of SSBs by evaluating their energy efficiency and carbon footprint in comparison to conventional batteries, followed by an exploration of end-of-life challenges, including disposal risks, regulatory frameworks, and the shortcomings of existing waste management practices. A significant focus is placed on recycling and reuse strategies, reviewing current methodologies like mechanical, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical processes, along with emerging technologies that aim to overcome recycling barriers, while also analyzing the economic and technological challenges of these processes. Additionally, real-world case studies are presented, serving as benchmarks for best practices and highlighting lessons learned in the field. In conclusion, the paper identifies research gaps and future directions for reducing the environmental footprint of SSBs, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to advance sustainable SSB technologies and contribute to balancing technological advancements with environmental stewardship, thereby supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy future.",

In response, Company B strongly believed that low-carbon technologies would not supply sufficient energy for their operations. Companies A and Z agreed. Company Y disagreed with the statement, showing its capacity to incorporate renewable energies for its operation. This result (Table 3) shows varied responses among companies. Overall, this result suggests that electricity produced by low-carbon technologies is considered to be insufficient for mining operations, but this does not mean that all mining companies are incapable of adopting low-carbon technology. \n\nConcerning policy decision making within the area of their companies' operations, we questioned the extent to which the companies agreed that low-carbon technology is not emphasized at the top of the company policy agenda. All the companies disagreed (Table 3), suggesting that these companies placed a high priority on reducing carbon emissions. Among them, two companies (A and B) strongly disagreed, whereas the rest disagreed (company Y and Z). The study of the range by mean interpretation reveals that all four companies strongly disagreed (Table 3). \n\nIn terms of technical competence, we asked about the extent to which the companies were capable of managing low-carbon technologies using available workers. Companies A and Z agreed that additional technical knowledge is required to handle updated low-carbon technologies. Company Y was not sure (Table 1). We found that all elements of innovation, including adoption, operation, and maintenance, require technical skills. The skill level and capacity differed widely among companies.",

                "abstract": "Efforts for carbon emission reduction have been identified as a major climate change mitigation target in the Paris Agreement. The 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change highlighted the worldwide effort for cleaner and greener mining, urging the mineral industry to embrace greener operational emissions reduction technologies and strategies. At the Paris Conference, Ghana pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 15% and increase its renewable energy share to 10% of the national energy mix. Ghana’s efforts to implement a low-carbon policy were, however, hampered for several reasons. Ghana is Africa’s leading and the world’s seventh largest gold producer. Mining has contributed significantly to foreign currency acquisition and government revenue. The gold mining sector contributes approximately 95% of Ghana’s total mineral revenue. Considering these situations, the fundamental question is how Ghana’s mining industry can contribute to CO2 emission reduction efforts. This paper investigates barriers to low-carbon emission policy implementation among mining companies in Ghana. We adopted 5-point Likert scale statement questions. The questionnaire survey was conducted among Ghana’s four large-scale gold mining companies. As the sample number of available companies is limited, we used a descriptive analysis to assess the responses. The results show that the companies expressed widely different ways to respond to the issues of cost, a government policy for carbon emission reduction, and the acquisition of low-carbon technologies. Those companies that are relatively less prepared for this endeavor emphasized the uncertainties of securing sufficient energy in case of using low-carbon technologies. They also expressed a need for more trained workers to handle low-carbon technologies. We found that a major challenge among companies was the expected cost involved in implementing a low-carbon emission policy. There was a communication gap with the relevant government ministry about low-carbon mining options where the government should be able to facilitate the involvement of low-carbon technology providers, such as solar Photovoltaics installation.",

To this end, Muduli et al. [10] assert that we can put many factors in place, such compliance with legal requirements, appealing to financial institutions, and enhancing eco-efficiency. \n\nTherefore, effective integration of SDG 7 requires support for the early implementation of renewable energy to achieve the goal of a low-carbon economy. In addition, boosting the direct production of renewable electricity by these companies will reduce their dependence on grid power supply, eliminating the need for increased generating capacity and improving system flexibility. Furthermore, the resilience of renewable energy sources (RES) to global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, further underlines their importance. Studies have shown that the renewable energy generation sector is less affected by these disruptions than conventional energy sources [11]. \n\nBesides, many articles take sustainability considerations into account when developing mining sites. However, Tsisilile Igogo et al. [12] review the literature to analyze the challenges, possibilities, and enabling strategies for renewable technology integration in mining operations. Anshul Paneri et al. [13] examine the techno-economic viability of RES for switch-on, switch-off mining, a new idea for mobile small-scale mining, in 2021. Eduardo Vyhmeister et al. [14] evaluate the use of photovoltaic and revolutionary wind technologies to supply as much as 10 % current and projected electrical energy needs of the mining industry in Chile. A. Strazzabosco et al. [15] assess the current adoption of clean energy among the mining houses in Australia. Also, literature highlights the integration of renewable energy in the African region. Fabien Muhirwa et al. [16] reviewed research published during the period 2000 to 2022 on substantial extractive industry investment, the associated issues and sustainable development potential of rural communities residing in African mine sites. In Morocco, renewable energies play a pivotal role in the energy strategy. The country possesses significant renewable potential, letting it meet a substantial proportion of its growing energy needs by replacing fossil fuels. Therefore, Morocco aims to increase the share of renewable energies in installed electricity capacity to over 52 % by 2030 [17].",

Radioactive waste management involves several steps: collection, characterization, sorting, processing, storage, and disposal. These steps are further detailed in a flowchart illustrated in Figure 7. Safety concerns linked to nuclear power plants present the most substantial weakness. Despite modern reactor designs and stringent safety measures that mitigate risks, accidents and incidents can still transpire (Jang & Park, 2020). Nuclear power plants must adhere to rigorous safety protocols, maintain emergency preparedness, and provide ongoing training for personnel to ensure the secure operation of facilities. Regulatory frameworks must be in place to enforce safety standards and oversee compliance. Addressing safety concerns is pivotal for upholding public confidence and reducing potential risks of nuclear power generation. 184 Josia",

There is an ongoing demand for a new source of energy that is reliable, affordable, safe, and clean. This research has assessed the feasibility on implementing nuclear power plants in Indonesia using systematic literature review based on a comprehensive SWOT analysis, IFE/EFE matrix analysis, and TOWS analysis. The obtained result is that the impacts of internal and external factors are assessed as moderate-positive and positive, respectively. The research implies that strategies regarding investments, benefits, waste management, and collaborations with other alternative energy sources can significantly maximize the benefits and overcome challenges. This study contributes to the understanding of nuclear energy implementation in Indonesia and provides insights for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers seeking to explore and promote sustainable energy solutions in an urgent need regarding increasing energy demand.",

                "paragraph": "Long-term management of spent fuel is becoming of increasing concern, since few decisions are now available with regard to the implementation of their final disposal. This might be attributed to the public perception towards the final disposal of spent fuel and/or the need to gain better insights into the long-term performance of spent fuel and materials. This class of radioactive wastes is currently stored in different storage types. These include, nuclear power plant pools, wet and dry storage facilities. Figure 2   Interim storage of radioactive waste packages is not only required if the disposal facility is not available but also for wastes those include very short lived radionuclides. The design and operation of storage facilities must comply with the basic safety principles set up on both the national and international scale. To assess the compliance of the storage facility, a licensing process including safety and environmental impact assessments must be part of the waste management system. The main functions of a storage facility for conditioned radioactive waste are to provide safe custody of the waste packages and to protect both operators and the general public from any radiological hazards associated with radioactive wastes. The design of storage facilities should be capable of (IAEA 1998) 1. Maintain the \"as-received\" integrity of the waste package, 2. Protect the waste from environmental conditions that could degrade it, 3. Keep the external dose rate and contamination limits for waste packages to be accepted by the facility, 4. Minimize the radiation exposure to on-site personnel, 5. Allow control of any contamination from gaseous or liquid releases. \n\nThe storage facility may be associated with an area for inspection (including sorting and/or non-destructive examination), certification and labeling of waste packages. The storage facility is usually divided into areas where low contact dose rate packages are stored, areas where packages not meeting waste acceptance criteria (WAC) are stored, and a shielded area where high contact dose rate packages are kept secure (IAEA 1998). The design of the facility usually permits package stacking, sorting and visual inspection. Provision for maintaining a database keeping chain-of-custody for each waste package in storage must be included in the design. Key information about the waste package should include the total radionuclide content, the waste matrix used for immobilization, the treatment and/or conditioning method (as applicable), and the unique package designator.",

Also, historical tests of nuclear weapons, nuclear and radioactive accidents and the deliberate discharge of radioactive wastes are representing major sources for this pollution (R.O. Abdel Rahman et. al 2012). Several international agreements and declarations were developed to control the radioactive pollution especially those related to the discharge of radionuclides to the environment. These agreements and declarations impose obligations on national policies to prevent the occurrence of radioactive pollution (IAEA 200a, 2010). On national scale, governments are responsible for protecting the public and environments; the manner at which this responsibility is implemented varies from country to country by using different legislative measures.",

To ensure the long-term viability and public acceptance of nuclear energy and its applications, it is essential that any waste generated is safely and efficiently managed from the point of generation through to disposal. \n\nThe end point of NWM is always disposal, i.e., the emplacement of radioactive waste into a facility or location with no intention of retrieval. The key to achieving this is the development of an Integrated Waste Strategy (IWS) [13]. As the NWM is a country responsibility, every single country should have some form of policy and strategy for managing its spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste [13]. \n\nNWM practices including disposal should always comply with IAEA safety principles, which are provided by the IAEA standard SF-1 [14]. The fundamental safety objective set by the IAEA SF-1 standard is to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation; however, this needs to be achieved without unduly limiting the operation of facilities or the conduct of activities with the 10 safety principles [14]. The IAEA safety principles provide the basis for requirements and measures for the protection of people and the environment against radiation risks and for the safety of facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks, including nuclear waste disposal facilities and activities as an integral part of NWM [15].",

The disposal of nuclear waste is the end point of nuclear waste management (NWM) activities and is the emplacement of waste in an appropriate facility without the intention to retrieve it. The IAEA has developed an internationally accepted classification scheme based on the end points of NWM, which is used as guidance. Retention times needed for safe isolation of waste radionuclides are estimated based on the radiotoxicity of nuclear waste. Disposal facilities usually rely on a multi-barrier defence system to isolate the waste from the biosphere, which comprises the natural geological barrier and the engineered barrier system. Disposal facilities could be of a trench type, vaults, tunnels, shafts, boreholes, or mined repositories. A graded approach relates the depth of the disposal facilities’ location with the level of hazard. Disposal practices demonstrate the reliability of nuclear waste disposal with minimal expected impacts on the environment and humans.",

                "paragraph": "With respect to nuclear waste management, it is known that any use of nuclear power technologies produces radioactive waste as a byproduct, which necessitates waste management in order to ensure the sustainability of a NES. To minimize the burden passed to future generations, the waste arising from a NES should be minimized and waste should be moved to the end states, ideally, passively safe in the long term, as soon as is practical. The generation that enjoys the benefits of the activities giving rise to the waste should assume responsibility for it and, as much as possible, not pass this responsibility on to their descendants. If such a transmission of responsibility can be reasonably justified, then the 'user pay' principle has to be applied and the necessary resources have to be accumulated and transferred along with waste that is generated. \n\nCountries operating nuclear installations need to have a commensurable waste management system. Many different waste streams may arise from the NES or even from a single installation and many potential waste management steps may be needed to eventually achieve the end states with the intention of not treating them further. For each waste stream, including secondary waste from a given facility of a NES, a waste management plan needs to be developed setting out how the waste will be managed through the whole lifecycle from generation to the end state. End states may include free or unconditional release, recycling and reuse, and permanent disposal in different types of engineered disposal facilities. Waste storage or spent fuel storage are the interim steps and geological disposal for spent fuel or high level and long-lived waste is considered in the INPRO methodology to be superior compared to permanent storage due to the lower burden passed on to future generations, regardless of the potential economic preferences. \n\nAny NES needs to involve measures protecting humans and the environment from adverse effects of radioactive waste now and in the future. Having in mind Brundtland's definition of sustainable development, it is recommended that such a system should include provisions for covering the lifecycle expenses of waste management facilities introduced and operated now, as well as provision of resources for safe management of waste and occasionally for the disposal of waste in the future. Recognizing that the reliability of safety features involving long-term institutional arrangements is expected to decrease over time, the plan for radioactive waste management should not rely on them.",

                "paragraph": "Higher education has historically been viewed as a vehicle for social mobility. Education, in general, presents an opportunity for self-improvement by way of comprehensive skill development and growth of knowledge. Holistic self-improvement in this fashion raises our professional marketability for consideration for higher levels of employment and salary. For the purpose of this section, social mobility is the progression of an individual or community toward a place of socioeconomic equity and well-being; often made possible through increased access to financial, educational, or social resources. This definition does not, of course, assume that all people or groups naturally experience socioeconomic equity and well-being. Rutgers University in New Jersey is an example of a higher education institution which fully understands how educational opportunity can provide a path away from cyclical poverty. Rutgers reserves 10% of its first-year undergraduate admission slots for lowincome students, in an effort to provide increased opportunity and access to marginalized students (McAnuff & Ambrose, 2010). Rutgers University also remains deeply involved in social mobility initiatives within the state of New Jersey; including a university-sponsored program that is designed to develop middle school students culturally, intellectually, and socially. Although the students are direct beneficiaries of the resources provided by Rutgers University, the public benefit of such initiatives cannot be ignored. As more individuals and communities in New Jersey socially mobilize, the overall citizenry of New Jersey will be enhanced culturally, intellectually, and economically (McAnuff & Ambrose, 2010). Savvides and Stengos (2009) found that each additional year of higher learning increases the likelihood of students' social mobilization. This relationship between education and social mobility does not consider the impact of other socially oppressive phenomena, e.g. gender pay gaps or racial prejudice in employment (Wells, 2008). However, the American job market has become increasingly competitive, as more jobs are requiring that candidates have some level of college education. The National Center for Educational Statistics (2018) reported that the national employment rate in the United States was highest among those who had earned a bachelor's degree or higher at 89%. The second highest was among those who had completed some college, but no degree at 79%, followed by no college at 72%.",

Educational upward mobility requires more than individual effort and intelligence, and sometimes different ingredients, such as specific social conditions. The different dimensions of inequality—income, poverty, social exclusion, education and social mobility—are interconnected. The paper has been inspired by Bourdieu’s work on symbolic domination and capitals, and lifestyles. The author identifies a persistence of inequalities among the students due to social reproduction mechanisms: family background and parents’ social situation have a substantial influence on the life chances.

Through education, individuals can acquire higher knowledge and skills, thereby gaining higher status and better living conditions in society. However, regional educational inequality limits the possibility of social mobility. In areas with scarce educational resources, students often find it difficult to access the same educational opportunities and quality as urban students, which puts them at a disadvantage when entering higher education and the labor market. Over time, this educational inequality has solidified social classes, leading to a decrease in social mobility. For example, in rural areas, many students are unable to access high-quality educational resources and ultimately have to stay in their hometowns to work in low-income jobs, which makes it difficult for them to break the poverty cycle of their families and greatly limits social mobility.",

The foundation of social development is education, and regional differences in educational levels hinder individual growth and social progress. This article explores the main causes and impacts of regional education inequality. According to the data provided in this article, the two main reasons for regional education inequality are policy and economic factors. Economically developed regions have more high-quality teachers and educational resources, while economically underdeveloped regions lack resources, which affects the quality and competitiveness of students' education. In addition, differences in household income and parental education levels further exacerbate inequality. The government has made some efforts to narrow the regional education gap, but the effectiveness of policy implementation is limited by differences in local fiscal capacity. Therefore, this article proposes some suggestions to address regional education inequality, including balanced allocation of educational resources, strengthening the construction of teacher teams, formulating policies to promote educational equity, and promoting innovative educational technologies. Through policy guidance and technological means, it is expected to improve the quality of education in impoverished areas, gradually narrow the regional education gap, and promote social equity and economic development.",

                "paragraph": "Social mobility is affected at several points of the education continuum: early learning, school achievement, the transition to higher education, the stratification of higher education, and what happens in the passage from higher education to graduate labour. The stratification in higher education, plus the pattern of social access to high value student places, helps to determine how socially equal are the opportunities available. When modest economic growth is combined with highly unequal income distribution, and middle class families dominate high value places in a stratified higher education system, absolute social mobility is constrained, and there is no prospect of improving relative social mobility via higher education.\n\nIn higher education the main intrinsic limit to social equality of opportunity is the persistence of irreducible differences between families in economic, social and cultural resources. Government can partly compensate for economic differences but cannot eliminate the contribution of the family through cultural capital and social networks (Mountford-Zimdars and Sabbagh, 2013). Comparing 11 European countries, Triventi (2013a) finds that 'individuals with better educated parents have a higher probability of attaining a degree from a top institution, of a higher standard, and with better occupational returns' (p. 499). The effects of social background on graduates' occupational outcomes vary by country in four areas: the extent of educational growth, the social selectivity of education, institutional connections between higher education and labour market, and 'the degree of institutional stratification in higher education' (Triventi, 2013b, pp. 47-48). Unequal family background is more determining there is a great difference between top and bottom HEIs in the value of participation. All else being equal, socially advantaged families are better at using educational structures to advance their position, for example gaining access to selective universities (Shavit, et al., 2007;Lucas, 2009;Jerrim, et al., 2015;Marginson, 2016). The more powerful is family background in deciding children's destiny, the less scope there is for the bright, hard-working child from a poor family to become successful via higher education. The larger the determining role of prior social inequalities, the less scope there is for social mobility.\n\nSocial outcomes are primarily shaped by economic resources and social power, and inequalities are reproduced from generation to generation-unless government",

This question not only presents an important puzzle for social science researchers, it connects to the fundamental issue of social inclusion through equality of opportunity. Upward social mobility has generated an increasing body of research over the past two decades. Some studies focus on macro-level trends and the impact of structural factors, such as how rates of mobility have changed over time (Blau & Duncan, 1967;Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, & Turner, 2014;Legewie & Bohmann, 2018), how dif-ferences in educational institutions impact educational mobility (Alba et al., 2011;Crul, 2013), or how rates of mobility differ among regional contexts (Chetty & Hendren, 2018;Chetty, Hendren, Kline, & Saez, 2014). Other scholars focus on individual characteristics as factors for upward mobility, such as intelligence or other cognitive abilities (Deary et al., 2005;Heckman et al., 2006), preference for educational tracks (Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997;Goldthorpe, 1987), or personality (Damian et al., 2015). Still others scrutinize people's social environments, where factors such as socialization within the family (Lareau, 2003), transmission of aspirations, narratives, and plans for the future (Harding, 2011;Legewie, 2016), or access to social support and cultural knowledge (Lareau, 2015;Stanton-Salazar, 2001) have been key concerns. This article focuses on such social environment factors for understanding upward educational mobility. \n\nI study educational trajectories of disadvantaged students in Germany.

This question presents a fundamental puzzle for social science researchers and has generated an increasing body of research. The present article tackles the puzzle using a life course and personal network lens. Studying educational trajectories in Germany of students whose parents have low educational degrees, it asks: What paths did students take through the education system, what personal network factors were important for their educational attainment, and how did these factors change over students’ life courses? In contrast to most studies that zoom in on a specific transition or time period, the article uses data from 36 retrospective in‐depth interviews that allow a sweeping view of respondents’ educational careers. Thanks to a systematic case selection scheme, the data also enables comparisons between students who became upwardly mobile and those who replicated their parents’ low educational degrees. Findings suggest four types of trajectories: direct upward mobility, indirect upward mobility, direct non‐mobility, and indirect non‐mobility. I discuss four personal network factors that seem to drive these trajectories: support with academic efforts, encouragement, support with solving problems, and role models. Upwardly mobile students showed combinations of two or more of these four factors that established higher education as the students’ goal, and provided them with tools and support to reach that goal. With these findings, the article contributes to literature on inclusion in education, social inequality and mobility, personal networks, and the life course.",

Results Results showed renters in gentrified census tracts overwhelmingly viewed gentrification trends as a negative change compared to homeowners. Overall, participants from gentrified census tracts reported being relatively satisfied with their neighborhood, though some suggested there were fewer resources in the neighborhood over time; felt their social cohesion had deteriorated over time; and more commonly reflected negative health changes over time.

                "paragraph": "One of the inevitable processes occurring in large urban centers is that of gentrification, defined as \"an interactive process in formerly declining, under-resourced, predominantly minority neighborhoods involving economic investment and increasing sources of capital infusion and in-migration of new residents, generally with a higher socioeconomic status [1]\". Substantial research has been conducted on the effects of gentrification on the various economic and structural aspects of the urban landscape, such as how these changes affect neighborhood racial, ethnic and class composition and social displacement, etc. [2][3][4]. The issue of displacement has become a hallmark of the gentrification process, in that the transformation of neighborhoods that allows for the influx of more affluent businesses and residents may simultaneously force out long-time residents, particularly those who are already economically marginalized, to the peripheries of urban centers and away from existing support networks [5]. This displacement may occur in a number of ways, including being priced out of a dwelling through rent increases or by physical means (i.e., economic/physical displacement) [6] or being unable to access property because it has been gentrified (i.e., exclusionary displacement) [6]. \n\nOne of the most notable effects of gentrification is the impact that it has on the communities that are displaced through the process. Research and history have shown that economically disadvantaged peoples-including but not limited to the elderly, persons from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds, etc.-are disproportionately driven (by poverty, structural racism, discriminatory housing policies, redlining, etc.) to live in under-resourced neighborhoods [7][8][9][10]. Because these same neighborhoods are the ones targeted for gentrification and urban renewal, these same communities of people are disproportionately represented among those who have been displaced by the process [11].",

These changes could negatively affect individuals’ access to and utilization of health care and social services, resulting in poorer health outcomes. This study examined the impact of gentrification and housing instability on drug users’ access to harm reduction and other health services. Data were collected from 139 clients of a large harm reduction organization. Results showed that 67% of the participants were either unstably housed or homeless, and about one-third of participants indicated that their current housing situations negatively affected their access to primary care (33.9%), behavioral health services (36.7%) and basic services (38.3%). While homeless individuals were still able to access services generally, a greater percentage—compared to those unstably or stably housed—reported difficulty accessing care. As these data were collected prior to the COVID pandemic, it is likely that many of our participants faced greater struggles with housing insecurity and health care access issues due to shutdowns and increased need for social isolation and quarantine. More work is needed to address housing instability and homelessness among already marginalized populations.",

Gentrification is typically characterized by in-migration of middle-and uppermiddle class people, often white, as well as increases in housing prices, new amenities, and social and cultural shifts (Schnake-Mahl et al. 2020). The mechanisms underlying gentrification -including quickening real estate development and rising real estate costs, patterns of middle-and upper-class inward migration and displacement of pre-existing low-income residents, and state sponsorship -remain debated, as do their causes (Hackworth and Smith 2001, Lees et al. 2007, Hwang and Lin 2016, Brown-Saracino 2017. Gentrification has been observed and documented since the 1960s. While early waves of gentrification were characterized by homeowners rehabilitating and moving into older housing in working-class communities, scholars have argued that contemporary gentrification is driven primarily by rental market real estate speculation by developers and investors (Aalbers 2019).\n\nTo date, residential displacement has been the primary focus of scholarly attention on the potential harms of gentrification. However, analyses using quantitative data have largely found that rates of residential mobility in gentrifying neighborhoods are not substantively different from those in other low-income non-gentrifying neighborhoods (Ellen and O'Regan 2011, Ding et al. 2015, Hyra 2016. Nevertheless, qualitative researchers and community advocates have continued to raise concerns about gentrification's harmful consequences (see Brown-Saracino 2017). As a result, scholars have also explored how gentrification can lead to other forms of displacement, such as socio-cultural and political displacement, as well as how patterns of residential mobility outcomes are stratified by race (Hyra 2015, Hwang and Ding 2020, Oscilowicz et al. 2020. In the effort to more fully understand the potential harms of gentrification, attention has also turned to the health and economic consequences of gentrification for lower-income residents.\n\nBecause gentrification results in higher area-level socioeconomic status, scholars have noted potential health benefits that may accrue via poverty deconcentration, better quality food options, improved access",

Resident Researchers in a Participatory Action Research study of community health in nine gentrifying neighborhoods across the Boston area hypothesized that financial insecurity is one pathway through which gentrification might harm health. We analyze qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 40 financially vulnerable respondents to understand how the experience of living in a gentrifying neighborhood produces feelings of financial insecurity, and how such feelings may be harmful to health. Results indicate that experiencing gentrification exacerbates respondents’ sense of exposure to financial risk, while simultaneously reducing the perceived efficacy of available buffers against financial risks. The threats to an individual’s financial security introduced by gentrification-related changes in the neighborhood environment are stressful because they are appraised as taxing and exceeding the coping resources available to individuals. This gentrification-related financial insecurity is a meso-level phenomenon, produced by interactions between respondents and the contexts in which they live, with uncertain and uneven outcomes. Based on our findings, we argue that feelings of financial insecurity are one pathway through which the experience of living in a gentrifying neighborhood shapes health.",

Since then, the term commonly has been used to refer broadly to the shifting characteristics, demographics, and identity of neighborhoods (Brown-Saracino 2010). \n\nThe experiences of long-term residents in gentrifying communities are important to understand because, as a number of scholars have demonstrated, low-income people, and most often people of color, are disproportionately impacted by the negative aftereffects of development efforts (Lees 2012(Lees , 2016;;Betancur 2011), and this has been extensively documented in the case of Chicago (Acosta-Córdova 2017; Hwang and Sampson 2014;Anderson and Sternberg 2013;Wilson and Sternberg 2012;Mumm 2008;Betancur 2002Betancur , 2005Betancur , 2011;;Boyd 2007;Patillo 2007;Hyra 2008;Pérez 2004;Lin 2002;Ramos-Zayas 2001). Importantly, predominantly Black and Latinx 1 neighborhoods near the Central Business District have been identified as among the most at risk of experiencing re-development and gentrification (Timberlake and Johns-Wolfe 2017). \n\nAt the same time, various groups mobilize in efforts to bring about development with more equitable outcomes and to minimize displacement (Morisson and Bevilacqua 2019;Dyson and Varady 2018;Martin 2007). In a parallel strand, some research on community-based organizations has examined how these organizations can work to miti-gate the adverse effects of structural inequalities as they impact individuals and families in impoverished circumstances (Vargas 2016;Marwell 2004Marwell , 2007)). \n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore resident and community organizer perspectives of community change in the context of neighborhood gentrification.",

                "abstract": "This exploratory study draws on qualitative interviews to investigate respondents’ perspectives about gentrification in their Chicago neighborhood. Prior research has demonstrated that place-based networks are crucial for the well-being of low-income and immigrant urban residents. A parallel though a previously disparate thread of research discusses the negative impacts of gentrification on long-term residents. I find that residents underscore concerns about their neighborhood’s decreasing affordability, as well as the impending loss of their neighborhood’s local Latinx immigrant identity, as central issues for their community. For residents, “place”, vis-á-vis the neighborhood identity, was central to their own construction of ethnic identity. Concurrently, I find that community organizers viewed place-based changes associated with gentrification as nonstrategic for their organization, whose operations have evolved “beyond the neighborhood”, and endeavor to meet the needs of low-income ethnic Latinx populations across the metropolitan region. I conclude that scholars of both ethnic identity and those studying urban inequalities may benefit from taking a place-centered approach in addressing the gentrification, community organizing, and residential displacement occurring within Latinx communities.",

                "paragraph": "We find significant negative relationship between active green space and poor or fair health only among those living in gentrifying neighborhoods. This would indicate that gentrification may amplify the benefit of active green space. However, among those living in gentrifying neighborhoods, our results indicate that the apparent benefit of active green space is driven by the experiences of high income and highly educated residents (i.e., gentrifiers). Meanwhile, those with lower levels of education and income did not appear to benefit, even in gentrifying neighborhoods. \n\nWe did not find evidence that benefit may vary by race in gentrified neighborhoods. In our stratified analyses among only residents of gentrifying neighborhoods, no single race/ethnic group maintained a benefit of active green space. \n\nThis may be explained by within-race difference in health status and experience of social exclusion. For example, among NH black residents, particularly in urban areas like New York City, substantial variation exists in nativity or ethnicity, and this may mask differences in outcomes by broad, heterogeneous racial/ethnic categories. While minority residents are found in past studies on gentrification and health to benefit least from gentrification, these studies have varied greatly in terms of population studied. \n\nOne taking place in New York City focused on pregnant women, a group which may have more in common than all adult representatives of heterogeneous racial and ethnic groups (Huynh and Maroko, 2014). In contrast, our measures of socioeconomic status (namely, income and education) would not vary significantly within each sub-group. \n\nAn additional concern for the health of poor and minority residents living in gentrifying neighborhoods is the potential for social, cultural or physical displacement due to neighborhood changes associated with gentrification such as rising prices of rent, lack of affordability in general, and changes to the cultural environment of a neighborhood resulting in social exclusion (Fullilove, 2001;Marcuse, 1986). The result of these disparities since the 1990s has been widespread examples of gentrification in cities. Our results show that social exclusion contributes to determining who benefits from the exposure to urban active green space and who does not, where those who do benefit are those among the \"gentrifiers\" (i.e., those with high levels of education and income).",

These student handbooks were publicly available; they were posted online on school district websites. This analysis revealed racially coded language and sexist and outdated guidelines, raising the question of whether dress codes really are intended to promote academic success, or if they exist to maintain hegemonic White supremacist and patriarchal norms.

Recent work has aimed to provide textual summaries in the form of concise and salient short texts, i.e., key points (KPs), in a task known as Key Point Analysis (KPA). One of the main challenges in KPA is finding high-quality key point candidates from dozens of arguments even in a small corpus. Furthermore, evaluating key points is crucial in ensuring that the automatically generated summaries are useful. Although automatic methods for evaluating summarisation have considerably advanced over the years, they mainly focus on sentence-level comparison, making it difficult to measure the quality of a summary (a set of KPs) as a whole. Aggravating this problem is the fact that human evaluation is costly and unreproducible. To address the above issues, we propose a two-step abstractive summarisation framework based on neural topic modelling with an iterative clustering procedure, to generate key points which are aligned with how humans identify key points. Our experiments show that our framework advances the state of the art in KPA, with performance improvement of up to 14 (absolute) percentage points, in terms of both ROUGE and our own proposed evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated summaries using a novel set-based evaluation toolkit. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics in assessing the quality of generated KPs. Human evaluation further demonstrates the advantages of our approach and validates that our proposed evaluation metric is more consistent with human judgment than ROUGE scores.",

                "paragraph": "The Effects of Uniforms One of the major claims in previous research has been that school uniforms help improve behavior (defined by attendance rates, reported infractions, and bullying) and safety (defined by measure of gang presence, violence, and bullying) in a school. Many researchers have examined whether uniforms affect bullying, gang violence, and other disciplinary issues (Brunsma, 2004;Chime, 2010;Gentile & Imberman, 2012;Pate, 1999;Wade & Stafford, 2003;Walker, 2007;Woods & Ogletree, 1992). Some researchers reported that students had better attendance and fewer suspensions (Pate, 1999;Sowell, 2012;Stockton, Gullatt, & Parke, 2002), while others reported no increase in positive behavior or attendance or change in in-school infractions (Brunsma, 2004;Brunsma & Rockquemore, 1998;Sowell, 2012).\n\nHowever, the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators seem to support the notion that school uniform policies can increase the safety of a school (Bodine, 2003a;Chime, 2010;Hawkins, 2013;Woods & Ogletree, 1992). Students, on the other hand, might not always share the same perceptions as adults. Bodine's (2003b) research indicated that 88% of parents and 86% of teachers felt uniforms increase the safety of the school, but only 43% of students felt the same.\n\nAnother claim by proponents of school uniforms is that a uniform policy can increase students' academic success (Sowell, 2012). Once again, this research reported mixed results. Baumann and Krskova (2016) and Gentile and Imberman (2012) saw an increase in academic achievement, while Brunsma (2004), Sowell (2012), and Stockton and colleagues (Stockton et al., 2002) found no statistically significant increase in academic achievement with schools that have uniform policies. Another researcher reported gains in reading scores for elementary boys but not for girls (Pate, 1999). Gains in academic performance may be difficult to correlate with school uniforms because most schools implement a uniform policy along with many other policies designed to improve academics (Bodine, 2003b;Sowell, 2012). Regardless of these difficulties, there is some research suggesting that teachers,",

A survey was administered to 182 students in a charter school to gather perception information, and a separate survey was administered to parents to gather socioeconomic status information. An examination of individual survey items revealed older students were more likely to report that school uniforms help to reduce bullying and teasing, and some students of high socioeconomic status reported that uniforms help reduce arguments with parents about clothing. Student responses on 10 survey items were grouped into one factor called School Climate, reflecting student perceptions on how uniforms affect the school’s climate. Analyses revealed no significant relationships between the School Climate factor and socioeconomic status. However, Hispanic students reported a significantly more positive response overall than non-Hispanic students. These findings suggest students of various socioeconomic status perceive school uniforms similarly, but older students could be more likely to associate uniforms with a reduction in bullying.",

                "authors": "J. Reidy",
                "paragraph": "This review demonstrates that far from being a \"trivial relic\" [22], school uniform is an important yet neglected public health issue that affects all students who are required to wear it. As a preliminary review, this study maps the conceptual landscape of school uniform garment design and policy in a public health framework, and brings evidence together to show health and education impacts of school uniform use. The review shows that school uniform is important, but not for commonly believed reasons. First, there persists a belief that school uniform in itself enhances academic outcomes. This is unsupported by evidence-there is no direct link between uniform and academic achievement [33]. However, uniform does contribute to a more settled classroom environment [21], which facilitates learning. Second, some studies argue uniform can distract from a good rapport between students and teachers, which is linked to improved learning (30,37). Third, despite common belief, uniform has no empirically supported impact on enhancing a feeling of belonging to a school [85]. Notably, there is a general paucity of evidence for use and a gap between what is believed about uniform and what is supported by empirical evidence. It appears that uniform use and policy is a neglected area of research: given its widespread use there is surprisingly little empirical evidence about its use or effects at all. \n\nConcerningly, psychological and physical health impacts of uniform have been neglected. Positively, uniform removes the psycho-social barrier of competitive dressing. Indeed, welldesigned uniform garments that are comfortable to wear, do not restrict physical activity for all students, that protect against environmental hazards, plus a uniform policy that is inclusive of all students (irrespective of gender/gender identity) can enhance student physical and psychological health [47,48,54]. Neutrally, uniform can both increase and decrease bullying. Negatively, inflexible uniform policies and garment design disadvantage girls, gender-diverse students, and overweight students because they do not feel confident in participating in physical activity while wearing uniform garments (47)(48)(49)(50)(51)53). From a physical health perspective, empirical evidence demonstrates that girls' physical health is particularly disadvantaged. Girls make up around half the school-aged population, so the demonstrated link between poor uniform design and worse physical and psycho-social health for girls is of concern.",

It also reviews the underlying rationales for school uniform use, exploring historical reasons for uniform use, as well as how questions of equity, human rights, and the status of children as a vulnerable group are played out in debates over school uniforms. The literature identified indicates that uniforms have no direct impact on academic performance, yet directly impact physical and psychological health. Girls, ethnic and religious minorities, gender-diverse students and poorer students suffer harm disproportionately from poorly designed uniform policies and garments that do not suit their physical and socio-cultural needs. Paradoxically, for some students, uniform creates a barrier to education that it was originally instituted to remedy. The article shows that public health offers a new perspective on and contribution to debates and rationales for school uniform use. This review lays out the research landscape on school uniform and highlights areas for further research.",

In general, these voices focus on grounding the discourse in terms of the capability of existing legal norms-especially those laid down in IHL-to regulate the design, development, and use, or to prohibit the use, of emergent technologies. In doing so, these commentators often emphasize that states have already developed a relatively thick set of international law rules that guide decisions about life and death in war. Even if there is no specific treaty addressing a particular weapon, they argue, IHL regulates the use of all weapons through general rules and principles governing the conduct of hostilities that apply irrespective of the weapon used.

We thereby aim to shed light on and recast the discussion regarding “autonomous weapon systems” (AWS). We define “war algorithm” as any algorithm that is expressed in computer code, that is effectuated through a constructed system, and that is capable of operating in relation to armed conflict. In introducing this concept, our foundational technological concern is the capability of a constructed system, without further human intervention, to help make and effectuate a “decision” or “choice” of a war algorithm. Distilled, the two core ingredients are an algorithm expressed in computer code and a suitably capable constructed system. Through that lens, we link international law and related accountability architectures to relevant technologies. We sketch a three-part (non-exhaustive) approach that highlights traditional and unconventional accountability avenues. We focus largely on international law because it is the only normative regime that purports—in key respects but with important caveats—to be both universal and uniform. In this way, international law is different from the myriad domestic legal systems, administrative rules, or industry codes that govern the development and use of technology in all other spheres. By not limiting our inquiry only to weapon systems, we take an expansive view, showing how the broad concept of war algorithms might be susceptible to regulation—and how those algorithms might already fit within the existing regulatory system established by international law.",

                "abstract": "As technology progresses and autonomous weapons increasingly become a reality rather than mere science fiction, an ethical debate has developed surrounding the use of such weapons, which operate with little or no human oversight. Some view the use of autonomous weapons as morally preferable (not to mention strategically advantageous), as they can be used in place of human combatants. Others oppose their use for moral and legal reasons. This chapter analyzes arguments on both sides of the question and discusses challenges to limiting and defining autonomous weapons. The chapter acknowledges that some form of autonomy in weapon systems is here to stay, but seeks to limit potential catastrophes by recommending the adoption of an international agreement to ban fully autonomous weapons—those which cannot be recalled—as a first step toward addressing the issues raised.",

These systems impose various ethical, legal, and societal concerns with arguments both in favor and opposed to the weaponry. Consequently, an international policy debate arose out of an urge to ban these systems. AWS are widely discussed at the Human Rights Council debate, the United Nations General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, and at gatherings of the Convention of Conventional Weapons (CCW), in particular the Expert Meetings on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). Early skepticism towards the use of AWS brought a potential ban to the forefront of policy making decisions with the support of a campaign to 'Stop Killer Robots' launched by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) in 2013. The movement is supported by Amnesty International, Pax Christi International, and the International Peace Bureau, among others. This campaign has catalyzed an international regulation process on the level of the United Nations (UN).

While there is significant support for a ban, as indicated by campaigns and recommendations for international agreements, there are also substantial obstacles, such as political and military resistance, and a lack of consensus among states. The evidence suggests a divided stance, with both support and opposition present, leading to a partial truth assessment."
