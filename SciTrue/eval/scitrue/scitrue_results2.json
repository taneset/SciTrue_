One study suggests that empowering youth and women through an unconditional basic income grant can drastically reduce regional, youth, and gender-based poverty, based on simulations using Ivory Coast's 2015 household survey data (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:134810747'>Eugene et al., 2018</a>). Another study finds that even a fiscally neutral starter scheme could reduce child poverty to the lowest level since 1961, outperforming past anti-poverty interventions (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:256182695'>Reed et al., 2023</a>). Additionally, simulations show that a UBI scheme with transfers amounting to 5 percent of average per capita income could impact poverty, although the required budget is higher than current safety net expenditures in low- and middle-income countries (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:213166641'>Majoka et al., 2019</a>). Advocates argue that UBI could reduce poverty, promote individual freedom, and prepare societies for technological disruptions, but critics highlight concerns about cost and potential inefficiencies (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:276140508'>Csősz, 2025</a>). Finally, UBI is seen as a new socio-economic direction to mitigate economic inequality and address poverty, though its effectiveness depends on practical implementation and integration into social protection systems (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:266591182'>Скачкова et al., 2023</a>).",

There are 52 countries with around 4.2 million observations in total. To estimate poverty rates, per capita income or per capita consumption variable in LCU is used depending on which concept is used to measure national poverty in a particular country. 13 lative poverty rates are measured since the objective here is to compare the poverty impact of two types of cash transfers -UBI and TUBI -in both low and middleincome countries. The poverty line is set at 50 percent of median per capita income or consumption in each country. The poverty impact of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme is simulated where the amount of transfer to each individual is 5 percent of average per capita income or consumption. The total budget required for such a universal scheme varies across countries costing between 1.8 and 5.3 percent of GDP. Keeping this budget constant, a TUBI is designed where bottom quintiles receive a higher transfer amount, which then gradually decreases to zero (Figure 1). \n\nSince the budget required for these schemes is much higher than what LMICs currently spend on their safety nets programs, an alternative TUBI design is also considered where the total budget is reduced to half while coverage is also until sixth decile (Figure 1). \n\nThe TUBI can have both an income effect and a substitution effect whereas UBI generates only an income effect. 14 There is little empirical evidence on any significant impact on labor market behavior for the UBI. 15 The impact of the TUBI will depend on, among other things, the marginal tax rate implied by the taper. \n\n14 The income effect is caused by recipients' overall income increase.

Proponents point out that narrowly targeted programs exclude many of the poor. Critics point out that universality spreads limited resources thinly over the population limiting the impact on poverty for a given level of spending. While high income countries can claw back the transfer to the higher income group through a progressive income tax, this is not possible in developing countries where most people operate in the informal sector. This note looks at an alternative to either narrow targeting or UBI. It uses household survey data from 52 low and middle-income countries to compare the poverty impact of a UBI to a transfer that is gradually reduced as estimated consumption increases. The taper can be set at different rates and can lead to zero transfers to households above a chosen threshold. The tapered UBI (TUBI) can be based on proxy indicators for unobserved income from special surveys and administrative databases. Both are becoming more common as government databases are digitized.",

                "abstract": "This paper delves into the economic implications and feasibility of Universal Basic Income (UBI),\nconcentrating on the considerable tax burden necessary to fund a UBI system on a national scale. With UBI\nincreasingly seen as a potential solution to modern economic challenges, such as income inequality, poverty,\nand automation-driven job displacement, this analysis underscores the significant fiscal demands of\nimplementing UBI. Through a comprehensive literature review of global UBI trials and an analysis of\neconomic models and simulations, the paper explores UBI’s impact on labor markets, poverty alleviation,\nand income redistribution. Notable UBI experiments in Finland, Kenya, and Stockton have demonstrated\nUBI’s capacity to enhance well-being and provide financial security. However, these trials also reveal\ncritical concerns about labor market participation and, more pressingly, the heavy fiscal burden a UBI\nsystem would impose. The fiscal models reviewed in this study indicate that UBI, while promising in\nenhancing social welfare, would require substantial tax increases to support it. The results emphasize that\nfunding UBI would place a considerable strain on public resources, demanding either heightened income or\nconsumption taxes or innovative but untested funding sources, such as taxes on carbon emissions or\nautomation. Each of these potential funding mechanisms has profound implications for economic equity,\nefficiency, and social acceptance, and their viability is highly dependent on a nation’s specific economic\ncontext and fiscal policy landscape. Furthermore, the study assesses UBI’s potential long-term effects on\nlabor markets, finding that while UBI might support labor market flexibility by reducing economic insecurity,\nthe level of the payment and tax structure could significantly affect employment incentives. This complex\ninterplay of UBI payments and tax policies, which often disproportionately impact certain socioeconomic\ngroups, underlines the need for careful fiscal planning. If structured effectively, UBI could serve as a buffer\nagainst the economic disruptions caused by automation, providing displaced workers with the resources to\nretrain or pursue new career paths in a shifting job market. However, the increased tax burden raises\nquestions about long-term viability, as higher taxes could reduce disposable incomes, deter workforce\nparticipation, and, paradoxically, counter the economic dynamism UBI aims to foster. In conclusion, while\nUniversal Basic Income holds transformative potential for reducing poverty and supporting individuals in\nthe face of technological change, its implementation would require an unprecedented commitment of public\nfunds. This paper argues that UBI’s long-term sustainability depends on the development of funding\nmechanisms that can balance equity with economic efficiency, without placing undue strain on public\nresources or individual taxpayers. The substantial tax burden associated with UBI implementation must be\ncarefully managed to ensure that the societal benefits outweigh the financial costs, calling for further\nresearch into tax structures that align with economic and social goals.",

                "paragraph": "Migration is a process that is caused by a variety of factors both in the countries of exit and in the countries of reception. In addition, it influences numerous aspects of public life. This helps the sending and receiving countries to solve their immediate problems (economy, demography, politics, geopolitics), and thereby minimizes the security threats in these areas. On the other hand, the same process creates new challenges and security threats. Migration affects a variety of areas, aspects and types of national, regional and international security. \n\nMany experts consider migration as a phenomenon that has a direct impact on the quantitative and qualitative indicators of crime due to the fact that migrants, encountering unfamiliar situations, experience psychological and domestic difficulties, and this has a negative effect on their behavior in the new social environment. For the same reason, migrants themselves often become victims of criminal encroachments (Sakharov, 1974). Other scholars hold the view that the dominance of migrants leads to an increase in xenophobia, radicalism and extremism, as well as to individual outbreaks of ethnic conflicts (Starchenkov, 1997) Migration has an unconditional effect on various indicators of crime in host societies. An analysis of the sources on the study of the relationship between migration and crime has illustrated that there is some difference between developed and developing countries, both in the role of crime dynamics and in the composition of crimes. An important role is played by the migrants' countries of exit. In some developing countries, such as Central and Latin America, high crime is one of the reasons for the migration of people from these countries to more developed countries, including the United States and Canada. In economically developed countries, immigrants are most often one of the factors for increasing crime. For example, as noted by G.A. Antonopoulos, migrants account for 45.9% of the total prison population in Greece. At the same time, the co-income of migrants is approximately 6.4%. Most of the migrants are Albanians, about 63.7%. Migrants account for up to 27.6% of thefts, 24.9% of car thefts, 33.8% of robberies, 34% of rapes, 31.8% of murders (Mishchuk, 2016).",

The northern region of Brazil, particularly the bordering states with Venezuela, Roraima, and Amazonas, were disproportionately exposed to the influx of forced migrants. \n\nAt first, we find null effects of increased exposure to forced migration on the overall violent crime rate in Brazil. However, by leveraging our rich dataset and disentangling violent crime rates by nationality, age, and sex of the victims we find that the sudden influx of refugees increased violent crime involving Venezuelan victims. There is no evidence of a corresponding increase in violent crime in which natives were victimized. We evaluate the robustness of our findings by assessing the plausibility of the main assumption for the validity of our instrument. \n\nWe find that the violent crimes in which Venezuelans were victimized increased at a slower pace than their presence in the host country. This suggests that they were not disproportionately affected when compared to natives. We interpreted this finding with caution and emphasize that Forced migration and violent crime 211 it does not diminish the importance of providing support to vulnerable migrant populations. Forced migrants flee their homes seeking host countries for protection. Nonetheless, our findings seem to be driven by a surge in violent crime against male migrants between the ages of 15 and 39 living in the border region of Brazil with Venezuela. Based on the economics of crime literature and descriptive evidence, we suggest two potential mechanisms that might drive the positive relationship between forced migration and crime in our setting: anti-immigration-driven hate crimes and the presence of criminal organizations. However, it is important to note that we do not have clear empirical evidence to confirm these mechanisms. \n\nOur paper makes several contributions to migration economics literature. First, it adds to the scarce literature that solely investigates the relationship between migration and crime by providing novel evidence of a positive association in a distinct context than most other papers. On one hand, Bianchi et al. (2012), Bell, Fasani, and Machin (2013), and Ajzenman, Dominguez, and Undurraga (2023) find negligible or null effects of immigration on crime in Italy, the United Kingdom, and Chile, respectively.",

To answer this question, we exploit the unprecedented inflow of Venezuelans to Brazil. Contrary to fears propagated by the anti-immigration rhetoric, our two-stage least squares estimates reveal that the sudden influx of refugees did not affect violent crime in which natives were victimized. In fact, our results suggest that forced migration only increased violent crime involving Venezuelan victims. Victimization of migrants seems to have increased at a slower pace than their presence in the host country. Yet, it was concentrated among young males between the ages of 15 and 39 living in the border region of Brazil with Venezuela. Evaluating the causal impacts of forced migration in a developing context is crucial to providing governments and international agencies with rigorous evidence to support policy decisions. In the absence of the latter, public perception can play a key role as host populations may pressure authorities for anti-immigration policies based solely on perceptions. Moreover, violence hinders migration’s documented long-term benefits by imposing high economic and social costs.",

                "paragraph": "Does the arrival of migrants result in more crime? This question is popular in the public debate, especially with regard to international migration into developed countries. However, the existing literature finds no or only very small effects of international migration on crime (and only for specific groups of migrants; Spenkuch 2011; Bianchi, Buonanno, and Pinotti 2012;Bell, Machin, and Fasani 2013;Chalfin 2015;Özden, Testaverde, and Wagner 2018). The question is potentially more relevant in the case of internal migration: Internal migrants are much closer substitutes to residents in the destination labor markets than their international counterparts. They do not face language barriers or legal restrictions to their participation, and they can often move at much lower costs, as internal mobility is mostly unregulated. In contrast, international migrant composition in terms of skills and demographics and associated labor market outcomes are, to a large part, determined by immigration regulations (Lazear 2020). Consequently, an influx of internal migrants may result in unemployment of either residents or migrants. The labor market effects of migration have been a particular concern in the literature on rural-urban migration (Harris and Todaro 1970;Todaro 1971), and recent empirical evidence confirms that migration into urban areas does indeed give rise to unemployment and lower wages (Kleemans and Magruder 2018). In turn, these labor market effects may lead to higher levels of crime-an association that has also been independently confirmed in the context of the United States (Grogger and Willis 1998;Gould, Weinberg, and Mustard 2002) as well as Brazil (Dix-Carneiro, Soares, and Ulyssea 2018). \n\nIn this paper, I provide the first evidence for the effect of internal mobility on local crime rates, focusing on violent crimes (homicides) in Brazil. Crime rates in Brazil are among the highest in the world (UNODC 2013). High crime, especially homicides, comes at a high economic cost. Aside from public safety expenditures, violent crime is shown to have a negative impact on human capital (Monteiro and Rocha 2016) and health (Manacorda and Koppensteiner 2015).",

In this paper, I provide the first evidence of the effect of internal migration on crime with panel data from Brazilian microregiões (microregions). Using local labor demand shocks as an instrumental variable, I find that a 10% increase in the in-migration rate translates to a 9.4% increase in the homicide rate in destination areas. I propose that the effect is driven by intermediating labor market effects and not by the migrants themselves. Exploring these possible channels, I do not find that crime-prone migrants drive the results. The effect is only significant in locations with high past crime rates, indicating crime inertia, and in places with a small informal sector, suggesting that the impact of internal migration is conditioned by the ability of local labor markets to accommodate migrants. This finding is supported by a negative effect of in-migration on formal employment in rigid markets and a positive effect on unemployment among young men, with the latter explaining most of the total effect.",

                "paragraph": "In the current study, migrant violent crimes do outnumber native violent crimes, which is generally consistent with previous studies. The prevalence of violent crimes among migrant offenders can be interpreted in a socioeconomic background. Looking back, income inequality inevitably elevates alongside the great success in economic revitalization in China [77][78][79]. Massive migration into the city because of income disparities makes it easier for internal migration to commit crimes [80]. Moreover, violence is regarded as the traditions connected with rural life and is brought into the city by the migrants from rural areas [81]. Nevertheless, migrant residents tend to lead a normal life in urban areas on the condition that more secure jobs and social welfare are accessible. In recent years, a series of household registration system reform programs have been carried out in China to accelerate migrants transforming into new citizens in urban areas. A significant step was the establishment of residence permit system in 2016. A migrant who possesses a residence permit will have some equal rights as a native citizen in terms of employment, basic public education, basic medical service, etc. The reform has been playing an active part because volume of internal migration shows a downward trend according to the Chinese Health and Family Planning Commission. \n\nThe differences between migrant and native offenders in committing violent crimes are majorly assessed by the spatial diversity of offenses and the influence of environmental factors. In particular, we examine ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points to uncover how diverse spatial patterns are shaped. The influence of these environmental factors on migrant and native violent crime counts will be further discussed to reveal the spatial behaviors of migrant and native offenders. \n\nAmbient population serves as a contributing factor for the occurrence of migrant violent crimes instead of native violent crimes. Before testing simultaneous effects of all environmental factors, the only inclusion of ambient population makes the residual autocorrelation close to zero in the model of migrant violent crimes, but the residual autocorrelation is larger than zero in the model of native violent crimes. The simultaneous regression results further support the positive effect of ambient population on migrant violent crimes. Treating all offenses as equal, ambient population is proved to better assess the population at risk for person-targeted crimes such as violence and theft from the person [49,82]. The distribution of ambient population reveals where people conduct activities in a day.",

However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders.",

While some studies suggest a potential increase in crime due to migration, particularly in specific contexts or regions, other evidence shows no statistical link between immigration and crime rates, or even a reduction in crime. The evidence indicates that the relationship is not straightforward and is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, the specific migrant population, and regional dynamics."

This phenomenon came to be known as the ‘Easterlin Paradox’. Easterlin explains this pattern using the relative income theory, which holds that the positive effect of income increase is offset by: (a) adaptation to income change and (b) social comparison. There is discussion as to whether this pattern is universal and, in this context, Easterlin et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 107(52):22463–22468, 2010) claim that the enormous economic growth in South Korea over the last decade has not led to an increase in average happiness. In this paper, we report an empirical verification of this claim, using other data on South Korea. Contrary to Easterlin’s claim, we found that South Koreans became happier over time and that the relative happiness theory did not apply in this case.",

There is a strong association between life satisfaction, joy, and external parameters, including environmental and socioeconomic factors and green innovation technologies. Marx's theory on life satisfaction provides an exciting insight and defines that economic resources are necessary to live comfortably. The core objective of this paper is to examine the effects of contributing parameters concerning life satisfaction and happiness (LSH) in China from 2005 to 2020. For this purpose, data collected for the dependent variable collect World Happiness Index and World Bank official website. Nine independent variables related to LSH discuss freedom to make life choices (FMLC); GDP growth; Social contribution (SC); Employment rate (ER); Social support (SS); Innovation and development (ID); Life expectancy (LE); Coverage of social safety (CSS); High qualification (HQ). The maximum LSH value is 5.77, with a mean value of 5.13. The highest coefficient correlation value with LSH is CO2, with a positive correlation coefficient value of 0.80, followed by GDPG, with a negative coefficient value of 0.80. PC1 explains 76.74% of results, whereas MLR produces 0.91 R2 (p-value: 0.093, Residual standard error: 0.181). There is a need to understand correlates and determinants in further detail to set up a framework that enables policy-makers to incorporate well-being and life satisfaction measures in carving new public policies.",

Accordingly, the pooled ordinary least squares, random-effects model, fixed-effects model, and two-step generalized method of moments were employed to estimate the effect of changes in happiness on economic growth. The empirical results suggest that economic growth of 1% to 3% can be obtained by increasing happiness. The positive effect of happiness is about four times greater in developed countries than in developing countries. This paper reveals that happiness should be included in conventional economic growth models to achieve a holistic approach in designing development policies.",

This paper analyzes empirically the failures to achieve full employment and national happiness promotion despite long-term economic development in the economic policies of liberal, socialist, and socio-democratic regimes. It is emphasizing unused resources such as chronic unemployment and surplus of capital as the main reasons for these failures. To fulfill these main purposes, a cyclical equilibrium development model of economy and society is suggested here. The roles of civilians are also stressed to complement the failures of the market and governments. And To achieve the flexible movement of labor and the complete use of surplus labor and excessively accumulated capital, the monopolization of the markets, governments, and civil bodies including large unions of labor and professional occupations must be removed. The employment of workers with relatively weak labor abilities is contributory to enhancing national happiness by increasing social as well as economic value especially in the period of economic depression. Policy directions and several measures including deregulation of markets, the punitive taxations on the preventions of labor mobility and excessive replacement of labor with capital intensive methods, and the expansion of social enterprises are also provided to enable the model to be applied in Korea.",

Participation in volunteer service acts as a mediator between party membership and subjective well-being, with party members gaining a sense of achievement and social support through volunteer activities, which further boosts their well-being. The study also finds that factors such as social support, economic status, and life satisfaction significantly influence subjective well-being.",

While there is evidence supporting a correlation between economic growth and happiness in certain contexts, such as in South Korea and across a spectrum of nations, the evidence also highlights significant limitations. The positive effects of economic growth on happiness are not consistent across all countries or over time, and they diminish as countries become more affluent. Additionally, other factors such as social comparisons and adaptation can weaken the link between income and happiness. Therefore, the claim is not universally valid."

Transportation generally accounts for less than 10% of the total emissions associated with a food product, unless the food is transported via air, which means the carbon-footprint estimates of eating local food items would likely only be marginally lower than those of food distributed from regional centers (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:256450141'>Dixon et al., 2023</a>).

Local food may not always be the cheapest food Participants of the study are from many places, and their personal decisions and habits are kept differently. Can we keep our sustainable eating values while abroad? Absolutely yes. But sometimes it is tricky, because we must face with differences in cultural eating habits, and they may diverge from ours to too great an extent. Openness can be critical in this case. Once one goes abroad, she/he takes the time and money to learn the new culture, to explore her/his eating habits in vastly different circumstances and surroundings. It is essential to mention that the references to food consumption preferences or sustainability criteria (carbon footprint, bioproduction, meat or vegetable, water footprint, etc.) specified in the literature were not mentioned or only tangibly mentioned during the interviews. However, the consumption of local foods has appeared almost everywhere during the conversation as the key to healthy eating, and this is an interesting phenomenon, because the participants described the circumstances of their stay abroad. \n\nStrengths: It is positive that our participants travel a lot, have considerable experience of the world, are culturally open to nationalities, and they are happy to try local dishes. There are many advantages of buying local foods: local food has less distance to travel, so it can be delivered and sold quickly after it is picked. With local food, one can support the local economy: local food can support hundreds of jobs at shops, even in small towns, and this, in turn, supports producers locally. According to our results, one of the main influencing factors in consumer food choices is freshness. By buying local food, participants can always rely on the freshness and tastiness of the product. Air-freighting of fruit and vegetables is an essential contributor to greenhouse gas pollution from our food supply system. It is also better to buy seasonally, and think about eating less, but better quality, meat and dairy, to cut the carbon footprint further. Local food may not always be the cheapest food available, but it is still affordable for many, and is generally of good quality. It is also worth buying local food because of the freshness, taste, and quality of ingredients.",

Foods and meals, in addition to sustaining life, also have many functions in society, such as human bonding. The purpose of our study is to present a qualitative research method to show the role of food consumption in the culture of several ethnic groups, and to introduce the ways in which cultural factors influence eating habits and local food supply conditions. In the first part of the research, the sample was a mix of multiple nationalities. During our investigations, the main questions were: What do you think about the culture and value food consumption? What kind of food do you consume the most? What differences do you find in the habits of different ethnic groups, especially regarding their eating habits? In the second part, we asked the main actors of the local supply system (restaurants, buffets, shops) about the ways they track the demand of foreign students. Our results have been implemented into two different SWOT matrixes. We can conclude that such research on food consumption attitudes and community behavior is essential. Most of the interviewed students are interested in comparing their diet and cultural traditions to those of other nations’, and prefer local foods. The study proved that eating habits in Hungary have an impact on the eating habits of international students, and they changed them from several perspectives. The study found that dietary choices are complex decisions that have a significant environmental and social impact, but we need to add that thanks to the strong cultural background, the students can keep their sustainable eating and community values abroad, which can also strongly influence the development of the local food supply practices.",

                "paragraph": "In the general discussion, local food is most often linked to sustainability via the concept of \"food miles\", i.e. the idea that transport-related emissions are so important that they can be used to determine a product's \"carbon footprint\". By extension, the suggestion is that local food is more sustainable because it is transported less. While this idea might be intuitive at first glance, it ignores the fact that there are many elements that impact a product's carbon footprint more than transportation, such as land use, production processes or storage (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). Farmers who operate in more favourable environments and are more productive may therefore be able to compensate for the greater \"food miles\" of their produce.\n\nThe carbon footprint of food systems is much more influenced by consumers' dietary choices than by the \"localness\" of the food they buy (Benis & Ferrão, 2017;Carlsson-Kanyama & González, 2009;Ritchie, 2020;Webb et al., 2013). Even eating more seasonal food, another common proposition to decrease the carbon footprint of food, is only another element of a sustainable diet that is overshadowed by the greater environmental and health benefits of dietary change, in particular to reduce overconsumption of meat (Macdiarmid, 2014). Similarly, carbon footprint reductions in local food systems can mainly be achieved with a reduction in animal source foods (Puigdueta et al., 2021).\n\nEven when only looking at transportation, \"localness\" can be a poor guide to determine a product's carbon footprint as, e.g., cargo ships or trains can exploit economies of scale and be relatively less polluting over longer distances than small trucks over shorter distances (Bell & Horvath, 2020;Schmitt et al., 2017;Tasca et al., 2017). Similarly, if consumers visit individual local producers, their carbon emissions can be greater than the emissions from the systems of large-scale suppliers (Coley et al., 2009). In short, it seems to be impossible to state that because of their localness, local food systems produce lower emissions compared to conventional ones (Paciarotti & Torregiani, 2021).\n\nTherefore, in the literature, there is general agreement that \"local\" cannot be used as a proxy, let alone a",

Differentiating between local food systems and short supply chains, a review of the literature on the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability is carried out. “Local food” cannot simply be equated with “sustainable food”; in most cases, it neither can ensure food security nor does it necessarily have a lower carbon footprint. For the environmental sustainability of food systems, many more factors matter than just transportation, not least consumers’ dietary choices. In terms of social sustainability, local food systems are not necessarily more resilient, but they can contribute to rural development and a sense of community. In terms of economic sustainability, selling via short supply chains into local markets can benefit certain farmers, while for other producers it can be more profitable to supply international markets.",

First, only one component of the environmental impact of food items was evaluated; other factors, such as the water footprint, were not included because of limited data. Second, a single day of meals does not capture the full impact potential of the diets. Each meal plan scenario is intended to be a succinct snapshot of a single day of eating; a different menu, even while still adhering to the dietary restrictions, could potentially have a higher or lower carbon footprint. Third, meals are likely to underestimate the total calories that most Americans eat. The FDA emphasizes that their 2000-calorie daily estimate is far lower than the observed 3800 calories consumed by the average American [77]. Thus, it can be assumed that the calculated carbon footprints are a vast underestimate of the ultimate environmental impact produced by food consumption. \n\nFinally, the emissions estimates are assuredly lower than actual emissions because they do not include emissions associated with the post-farm-gate components of the life cycle of each food item. The SEL and Song et al. databases provide the most accurate and current information concerning the carbon footprints of a wide range of food items, but neither dataset accounts for transportation in their provided carbon-footprint values [13,14]. The two databases instead focused on the carbon footprints of activities before leaving the farm gate, meaning that the environmental burdens associated with procedures such as packaging, market transportation, warehousing, and refrigeration or the energy required for food preparation within the home of the consumer was not included in their carbon-footprint calculations. While it may seem significant that transportation was not included in their carbon-footprint calculations, transportation has a minimal impact on the environmental burden associated with food consumption unless the food item is transported via air [78]. In most cases, transportation only accounts for less than 10% of the total emissions associated with a food product [5]. Because of this, the carbon-footprint estimates of eating local food items would likely only have been marginally lower than those of food distributed from regional centers.",

While there is a large body of literature reporting the health benefits of popular diets, few studies have described their planetary benefits. Our investigation aims to evaluate the simultaneous impacts of six popular diets within the United States on both human and planetary health. Using carbon footprint databases and representative meal plans, the environmental and health-related impacts of the Standard American, Mediterranean, vegan, paleo, keto, and climatarian diets are compared using the currently available literature. Results indicate that diets that exhibit lower carbon footprints also have positive effects on human health. The diets found to have the lowest environmental impacts were the vegan, climatarian, and Mediterranean diets. These low-carbon-footprint diets can likely be attributed to a reduced reliance on ruminant meat (cattle and sheep) and processed food consumption, while diets with high carbon footprints are more dependent on ruminant meat and saturated fat. Moderate consumption of meats such as chicken, pork, and fish in conjunction with an emphasis on locally grown fruits and vegetables can be maintained without adversely affecting the planetary carbon footprint and with the added benefit of promoting good health. Thus, making simple substitutions within each individual’s diet can be advertised as an effective approach to collectively lower the environmental impact in tandem with improving health and longevity.",

Consumption of food related to tourism is conditioned by what food service establishments offer and spatially determined by the limited area of a particular destination. The aim of this case study is, first, to investigate the city-wide spatial distribution of common restaurants and vegan and vegetarian restaurants (which in general contribute to sustainable food consumption), with reference to popular tourist attractions. Second, the research focuses on quantity of meatless dishes and the way they are presented on menus in order to investigate whether food service establishments nudge customers to select meat-based dishes. For the first objective, quadrat and network analyses were used to explore the spatial location of the investigated types of restaurants. For the second one, a comprehensive examination of menus of 21 restaurants at the Old Town Square, which is the most overcrowded place in Prague, was conducted. The findings suggest that vegan and vegetarian restaurants are not exposed to the tourist market as their distribution is rather dispersed, beyond the borders of the UNESCO area. Furthermore, the researched restaurants offered primarily meat-based dishes and also nudge their customers to select them.",

To achieve a sustainable food production system in Sweden, an integrated approach that considers all five of these dimensions, and all parts of the food production chain, is necessary. This paper systematically reviewed the literature related to food production in Sweden, especially in association with resource distribution and recycling logistics, and identified potential sustainability interventions and assessed their effects according to the five dimensions. Participation of stakeholders across the food production chain contributed with the focus of the literature search and subsequent synthesis. In general, there were synergies between the sustainability interventions and their effect on climate change and the environment, while there often were trade-offs between effects on the economy and the other dimensions. Few interventions considered effects on animal welfare or livestock epidemiology and few studies dealt with resource distribution and recycling logistics. This indicates that there is a need for future research that considers this in particular, as well as research that considers the whole food production chain and all dimensions at once, and investigates effects across multiple scales.",

                "paragraph": "Climate change presents formidable challenges to global food security, including extreme weather events, shifting temperature and precipitation patterns, and increased pest and disease pressures (IPCC, 2019(IPCC, , 2021;;Ali, 2020;Xiong;Reynolds;Xu, 2022). To address these challenges, plant breeding and seed systems must prioritize resilience to climate change and play a vital role in developing crops that can withstand these impacts and ensure sustainable food production. This involves developing climate-resilient varieties by selecting traits that enable crops to tolerate heat stress, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and other climatic factors (Khan et al., 2022;Rai, 2022;Zhao;Liu;Huang, 2023). \n\nAdvanced breeding techniques, such as markerassisted selection and genomic selection, can accelerate the development of climate-resilient varieties. Additionally, plant breeding can help mitigate the negative impacts of extreme weather events by developing crops with traits like flood tolerance, improved heat stress tolerance, and resistance to wind damage. Adapting crops to changing temperature and precipitation patterns, optimizing flowering time, improving water-use efficiency, and managing pest and disease pressures are other critical aspects (Kissoudis et al., 2016;Marsh et al., 2021;Cvejić et al., 2022;Karthika;Govintharaj, 2022). \n\nIn addition to breeding climate-resilient varieties, adopting agroecological practices can enhance the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change. Agroecology emphasizes ecological principles, biodiversity conservation, and the integration of crops with their surrounding ecosystems. By promoting agroecological approaches such as agroforestry, cover cropping, and crop rotation, plant breeding and seed systems can support climate resilience by fostering healthy, diverse agroecosystems that can better adapt to changing conditions (Altieri et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2019;FAO, 2021). \n\nFarmers' knowledge and experiences are invaluable in developing climate-resilient crop varieties (Ceccarelli;Galie;Grando, 2013). Plant breeding and seed systems should actively engage with farmers, involving them in participatory breeding programs, on-farm trials, and knowledge-sharing platforms.",

It underscores the importance of incorporating cutting-edge technologies, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and implementing forward-looking policies to meet evolving societal and consumer demands while aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Advancements in genetic editing, high-throughput technologies, precision breeding, and digital agriculture are transforming plant breeding, offering unprecedented capabilities to develop desirable traits, comprehend gene-environment interactions, and enhance crop efficiency. However, responsible innovation that considers ethical implications and regulatory frameworks remains essential in this context. Effective collaboration and engagement of stakeholders, including breeders, farmers, policymakers, and consumers, are vital for navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by this era of exponential change. Inclusive and multidisciplinary dialogues can harness diverse perspectives and experiences, contributing to a sustainable and resilient future for plant breeding and seed production. Ensuring access to diverse, high-quality seeds is crucial, especially in developing nations. Investments in seed infrastructure, capacity building, and farmer-centric approaches empower farmers and bolster seed security. In conclusion, the article underscores the significance of reimagining plant breeding and seed systems by embracing technology, promoting collaboration, and aligning strategies with the SDGs. By harnessing the potential of exponential changes, the envisioned future involves plant breeding and seed production that effectively address evolving societal and consumer needs, thereby contributing to agricultural resilience, global food security and sustainability.",

These practices aim to optimize resource use, increase resilience, and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture. One such practice is conservation agriculture, which involves minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining crop residue on the soil surface, and practicing crop rotation. These techniques help improve soil health, increase water retention, and reduce soil erosion, making crops more resilient to the effects of climate change (Kassam et al., 2019). Another innovative practice is precision agriculture, which utilizes advanced technologies such as remote sensing, drones, and data analytics to optimize resource allocation and improve crop management. By precisely monitoring and managing factors such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, farmers can enhance crop productivity and reduce resource wastage (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Agroforestry is another approach that combines the cultivation of trees with crops. Trees provide shade, windbreaks, and additional income sources, while contributing to carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. This integrated system can enhance the resilience of agroecosystems to climate change and improve overall productivity (Nair et al., 2011).",

In their opinion, the use of genetically modified plants prevents soil erosion (by using soil cultivation technology without plowing), reduces water and energy (fuel) consumption, and reduces CO 2 emissions (Święcicki et al., 2011, pp. 104-107).\n\nOpponents believe that genetic modifications are limited to changing only a few features, such as herbicide and pest resistance.

Methodology: For this purpose an analysis of provincial programs/strategies for the development was made. The programs indicate areas of importance for the region (the desk research method was used, which is a research method involving the analysis of available data). Value Added: The starting point for the considerations taken in the article is the Strategy for smart and sustainable development, which sets out the objectives and priorities of the European Union for the years between 2010 and 2020 [EC, 2010]. In response to the above mentioned strategies, the Ministry of Development in Poland has distinguished National Smart Specializations (KIS) [Internet source A], their idea is to identify key sectors for the socio-economic development of the country and their financial support from EU funds (Smart Development Operational Program - POIR). The five sectors of smart specialization include agri-food, forestry and environmental bio-economy, which emphasize the importance of increasing the country’s food security and improving food quality. Regional Innovation Strategies (RSI) are the response to KIS. They distinguish the smart specializations of the region, and their assumptions and goals are to be appropriate for the characteristics of the region. One of the biggest challenges of today is the climate change, which significantly affects the productivity of the agricultural industry. The European Commission in the White Paper and in its subsequent regulations emphasized the need to support local, regional, national and EU activities which will increase readiness and ability to respond to the effects of climate change (EC, 2013). Is it true that in connection with the above, the issue of adaptation of climate change to agricultural, as one of the important elements conditioning food security of the country, was taken into account when creating the concept of smart specializations? They do not decisively affect adaptation activities in the country, individual regions and industries, but in principle they are intended to raise important and current issues for the development of the country, and climate change and its consequences are undoubtedly such an issue. Recommendations: The analysis of Most Voivodeship Development Strategies carried out shows lack the appropriate form. The scientific language and extensive documentation make it difficult to complete tasks, fail to reach the right recipient, and promote excessive bureaucracy. This is probably not conducive to the development of innovation, but only drives bureaucracy and generates unnecessary costs.",

We conducted a scoping review using online databases to identify the prospects of orphan crops to contribute to (1) sustainable and healthy food systems, (2) genetic resources for future crop improvement, and (3) improving agricultural sustainability under climate change. The review found that, as a product of generations of landrace agriculture, several orphan crops are nutritious, resilient, and adapted to niche marginal agricultural environments. Including such orphan crops in the existing monocultural cropping systems could support more sustainable, nutritious, and diverse food systems in marginalised agricultural environments. Orphan crops also represent a broad gene pool for future crop improvement. The reduction in arable land due to climate change offers opportunities to expand the area under their production. Their suitability to marginal niche and low-input environments offers opportunities for low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agro-ecosystems, production, and processing perspective. This, together with their status as a sub-set of agro-biodiversity, offers opportunities to address socio-economic and environmental challenges under climate change. With research and development, and policy to support them, orphan crops could play an important role in climate-change adaptation, especially in the global south.",

While there is evidence supporting the role of genetically modified crops in enhancing climate resilience, there are significant limitations and alternative strategies that challenge the necessity of genetically modified crops as the sole solution.

        "summary": "The claim that biofuels are worse for the climate than fossil fuels is nuanced and depends on several factors. First-generation biofuels can have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than fossil fuels if no land-use change (LUC) is involved, but the reductions are often insufficient to meet stringent GHG savings requirements (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:227154035'>Jeswani et al. (2020)</a>). Second-generation biofuels generally have a greater potential to reduce emissions, provided there is no LUC, while third-generation biofuels currently have higher GHG emissions than fossil fuels (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:227154035'>Jeswani et al. (2020)</a>). However, it is not clear that biofuels reduce GHG emissions compared to fossil fuels, and first-generation biofuels can have severe environmental impacts, such as water pollution and biodiversity loss (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:219395992'>Cloutier de Repentigny (2016)</a>). Additionally, some biofuel crops can generate more GHGs than fossil fuels, depending on the feedstock and production processes used (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:251173420'>Arcentales-Bastidas et al. (2022)</a>). The land use associated with biofuels is likely to be a permanent fixture on the landscape, unlike the more transient nature of fossil fuel extraction (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:56324423'>Jordaan (2007)</a>). Despite these concerns, fossil fuels remain a more significant challenge for climate change, as highlighted by the continued reliance on them by developed countries (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:229418013'>Jabeen et al.

As stated multiple times in this thesis, their potential lies as a replacement to fossil fuels. However, as discussed in the introductory chapter, many doubts have been raised as to the actual environmental sustainability of biofuels. It is not obvious anymore that they do, in fact, reduce GHG emissions compared to fossil fuels. Furthermore, many biofuels, especially first generation biofuels, have severe impacts on the natural environment through water pollution and loss of biodiversity, amongst others. The underlying question is: can biofuels truly be considered environmentally friendly products? Even if they provide some benefits, are biofuels worth their environmental cost? The purpose of this subsection is to partly elucidate those questions through outlining the impacts of EU biofuels, mainly those related to GHG emissions, energy security, water quality and biodiversity.",

                "abstract": "Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. The European Union (EU), a leader in climate change mitigation, has adopted an ambitious strategy to achieve its mitigation goal. A piece of this strategy is the Renewable Energy Directive. The Directive establishes mandatory renewable energy targets for member states. Cognizant that in order to achieve the target of 10% of final energy consumption in the transport sector member states would have to rely heavily on biofuels, the EU, in the spirit of sustainable development, included in the Directive sustainability criteria for biofuels. The criteria were needed because, although biofuels can be carbon neutral and an effective replacement for fossil fuels, the production of biofuels can have serious environmental and socio-economic consequences. This thesis concludes that the Directive will not result in the sustainable production of biofuels. This conclusion is based on the principled lifecycle assessment of the Directive and its framework. This approach is a combination of core principles of sustainable development – integration, equity, precaution and polluter pays – and of the basic tenets of lifecycle assessment, a methodology designed to measure the lifecycle impacts of a product. Due to the reliance by member states on first generation biofuels, biofuels produced under the Directive’s regime are not likely to reduce GHG emissions compared to fossil fuels, and are likely to increase water pollution, the loss of biodiversity and food insecurity. The negative impacts of biofuels production are caused mainly by the agricultural production of feedstocks, especially through indirect land-use change. Furthermore, the cost of pollution is not internalized by the regime and biofuels subsidies are not linked to environmental concerns. Therefore, the lifecycle impacts of EU biofuels production do not accord with core principles of sustainable development. Only second and third generation biofuels, which are not yet available on a large-scale, seem to have the potential to be sustainable.",

                "paragraph": "Nowadays, there is a rising awareness about the future mitigation of fossil resources [1]. There is a general scientific consensus that the observed trends in global warming have been caused by the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels in human activities. The latter is threatening the global environment. For instance, more interest is beginning to be shown in the emergence of alternative sustainable energy sources [2]. \n\nBiofuels have been recognized as an alternative to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and thus help to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [3]. In 2018, global biofuels production reached 153 billion liters, increasing 7% compared to 2017 [4]. Biofuels account for approximately 3% of the global transportation sector [5]. The insertion of biofuels in the worldwide transportation has been slowly dosed due to the potential risk of globally reducing food production by allocating more arable lands for energy crops production [6][7][8][9]. \n\nAlthough many countries have promoted and implemented biofuels to address energy security and a more environmentally friendly economy [10,11], few scientists have suggested that biofuels development has been harmful to the environment, regardless of the country where it is produced [8]. The latter is justified because some crops can generate even more greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, depending on their production's feedstock and fuel processes [12]. Additionally, some emissions and environmental impacts are produced at other stages, as in the production of inputs used for crops and biofuels: pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers for crop production; chemicals production for biofuel processing, and emissions produced from transport and distribution to the field and industrial plants for crops and biofuels processing [13]. On the other hand, it is also essential to consider the emissions that can be generated from land-use change, triggered by increased biofuel production. The main effects of land-use changes are that the carbon dioxide accumulated in its vegetation escapes into the atmosphere, altering the impact of global warming [14]. For instance, a more detailed analysis of the environmental impacts of biofuels production is essential to have more solid evidence for policymakers to support biofuels development.",

                "abstract": "The present study compiles a life cycle inventory for Ecuadorian sugarcane-derived ethanol production to quantify its environmental performance and identify the life cycle stages that cause major impacts. The scope of this study encompasses a cradle-to-gate analysis that includes the agriculture, the milling, the distillation, and the co-generation of electricity. This assessment is modeled using the OpenLCA v1.10.3 software. Two functional units (FU) were established in this study: “1 ton of sugarcane at-the-farm-gate” for the agricultural stage and “1 L of ethanol at-the-plant-gate”. A hybrid attributional and consequential life cycle analysis (LCA) approach has been followed. Economic allocation (EA) and system expansion (SE) were used to take co-products into account in the milling and co-generation of electricity stages, respectively. The co-generation stage is analyzed in three different scenarios: (i) average mix displacement scenario where the surplus electricity produced in the co-generation stage is displaced; (ii) marginal technology displacement scenario where the marginal surplus electricity is displaced from the mix and (iii) no displacement scenario. The global warming potential (GWP) impact at the farm gate level was reported as 53.6 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq.) per ton of sugarcane produced. The two main contributors of the agricultural stage correspond to N2O lixiviation and volatilization with 34% followed by the diesel used in agricultural machinery with 24%. The GWP for 1 L of ethanol produced was reported as 0.60 kg CO2eq. based on the average mix displacement scenario. No displacement scenario has a GWP impact of 0.84 kg CO2/liter of ethanol The distillation stage has the highest contribution to GWP impact with approximately 61% followed by the agricultural stage with 47%. The co-generation stage reports a contribution of −8.4% due to the surplus electricity displacement. The scenarios where the system expansion method is applied have a lower GWP impact compared to the scenario where no surplus electricity is displaced. Regarding terrestrial acidification potential impact, 0.01528 kg of SO2eq. was reported at the ethanol production level especially due to the nitrogen and phosphorous content in the vinasse produced from the distillation process. The marine eutrophication impact for 1 L of ethanol produced was 0.00381 kg of Neq. due to the content of nitrogen contained in the vinasse and the use of nitrogenous fertilizers in the agricultural stage. Finally, to create more eco-friendly Ecuadorian sugarcane and ethanol industries, sustainable and less polluting processes should be sought to reduce the environmental burdens. Companies should apply industrial symbiosis and circular economy strategies to produce lesser environmental loads within the ethanol production chain. The sugarcane industrial sector should also promote the surplus electricity production in order to gain credits.",

                "paragraph": "Biofuels have been defined as any type of liquid or gaseous fuel that can be produced from biomass and used as a substitute for fossil fuels (Giampietro et al. 1997). The focus of this paper is on transport biofuels, or those that can be used as a substitute for gasoline and diesel. These renewable transport fuels come in the form of ethanol and biodiesel. Though biofuels are reported to have less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels (Farrell et al. 2006), potential impacts exist which may have ethical implications. Here, land use impacts are addressed. Though no studies were found that compare land transformation of fossil fuel production with biofuel production, a discussion of land use of different feedstocks for biofuels is still relevant. \n\nWhen compared with gasoline and diesel, one must recognize that the land use associated with biofuels will likely be a permanent fixture on the landscape rather than short-term developments such as drilling and production of fossil fuels. Herein lies the significance of a biofuel system; potentially large tracts of land will be permanently converted for producing feedstocks. This section is meant to discuss the land transformation associated with different biofuels to provide background for the ethical discussion to come. The figure and table are meant to provide some background on the magnitude and variability in land impacts rather than provide definitive values for these feedstocks. There are a variety of feedstocks that can be used to produce these biofuels, each with different impacts to land. A range of these feedstocks and the yields of these feedstocks are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to these feedstocks, there are also waste-to-fuel forms of biofuels such as yellow grease for biodiesel. The focus of this paper will be on agricultural biofuels, but waste-tofuel will be briefly discussed later. \n\nThese values are subject to several uncertainties (Maclean 2006, Worldwatch Institute 2006). There will be variability in performance depending on soil quality, climate and other local environmental factors. Physical location of the production is an important factor for determining not only yield, but ecological impacts. Yields noted in Fig. 1 are for specific geographic locations; for example, sugarcane would not be relevant in Canada.",

This provides opportunity to reduce emissions through alternative fuels. As a result, biofuels have recently become the focus of many climate change policy discussions. However, those produced from agricultural crops are not greenhouse gas neutral and have the potential to transform many of the earth's natural landscapes into monocultures. This land transformation leads to ethical trade-offs that should be addressed before policy is put in place. These trade-offs will likely result in competing social institutions with different values. A scientific approach to assessing ethics is too reductionistic to achieve a fair outcome. Normative ethical theory is discussed as a means to deal with competing values in a just manner. The Wide Reflective Equilibrium (WRE) process should be used to achieve the fairest policy.",

Biofuels are considered a critical developing process of renewable energies that is the drive from plant material, agricultural residual, and food waste. The biofuels are still not in positions to replace the fossil fuels in the energy sector, and researchers need to investigate about the biofuels (Stolze et al., 2016). Although fossil fuels are a more significant challenge for climate change, developed countries are ignoring the fossil fuels for energy generation. According to Berrill et al.

That model is presenting the power generation process on low carbon utilisation energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas. The model is also showing high shares of variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar. \n\nFossil fuels are an environmental challenge in the current period, and many researchers are suggesting using renewable energy sources to deal with environmental sustainability. Fossil fuels also impact on greenhouse gasses, and research is showing that anaerobic digestion is an effective replacing technology that combining biofuels production along with sustainable waste management, and other technologies are working biogas producing sector (Achinas et al., 2017).

Additionally, replacing added sugars with sugar substitutes could lower the risk of tooth decay and cavities and help manage blood glucose levels and weight in the short term (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:261988210'>Leśniewicz et al., 2023</a>). However, there are significant concerns about the long-term health effects of artificial sweeteners. Animal studies have shown that they can cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer, and other health hazards, with some side effects noted in humans as well (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:22905990'>Tandel, 2011</a>). Furthermore, artificial sweeteners have been associated with gastrointestinal issues, neurologic symptoms, cardiovascular risk, and diabetes (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:266713528'>Ghusn et al., 2023</a>). Despite their widespread use, some studies conclude that artificial sweeteners are unhealthy (<a href='https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:237477182'>More et al., 2021</a>). Overall, while there are short-term benefits, the potential long-term health risks suggest that artificial sweeteners may not be healthier than sugar.",

                "paragraph": "Sweeteners are natural and artificial food additives that provide a sweet taste in food and beverages. \n\nIn prehistoric times, the sweet taste of ripe fruits and vegetables guaranteed the hunting man the right dose of energy, and thus survival. People like sweet taste. Furthermore, they have continuous access to unlimited-compared to historical times-resources of natural sweeteners, e.g., honey or maple syrup. The most popular way to sweeten food products is to add food sugar, i.e., sucrose, in the form of cane or beet sugar. Sweetening properties have also been observed in substances such as honey, maple, or agave syrup. Unfortunately, all-natural sweeteners have high caloric value and glycemic index; therefore, if consumed in excess, especially as added sugars, they are recognized as a cause of weight gain and obesity, tooth decay inflammation, and oxidative stress [1]. In particular cases (such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)), the consumption of natural sweeteners higher than the recommended 10% of daily total calories can also cause the inability to maintain blood glucose levels at the appropriate level [2]. \n\nThe category of artificial sweeteners includes aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, sodium cyclamate, and sucralose. Synthetic sweeteners are popular among consumers due to their limited or even lack of calorie content, which is why they can be found in many kinds of foods and drinks labeled sugar-free or diet. Artificial sweeteners are safe for Molecules 2023, 28, 6618 2 of 13 healthy people in limited amounts. The replacement of added sugars with sugar substitutes could lower the risk of tooth decay and cavities and could help manage the blood glucose level and weight in the short term. However, there is no clear answer to the question of what the long-term health effects of sugar substitute use can be. This is why increasingly conscious consumers are looking for healthy alternatives to sugar and artificial sweeteners, paying attention to sweeteners of natural origin, such as xylitol or erythritol.",

The mineral composition of different sweeteners commonly added to foods was studied to estimate their mineral profiles and assess the risk related to the toxic elements intake caused by sweetener consumption. The concentration of twenty elements (Ag, Al, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Ti, V, and Zn) was measured using the inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) method after the representative samples were wet-digested with a concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixture in a closed-vessel microwave-assisted system. Differences between the mineral compositions of the examined sweeteners were statistically evaluated and discussed. The relationships between the concentrations of the elements determined in the analyzed sweeteners were also investigated. The successful application of the X-ray powder diffraction method proved the identity of all investigated sweeteners; all the analyzed products contained the expected sweetening agent. The results of the quantification of all the elements in the examined sweeteners indicated that these products cannot be considered nutritionally dense. Hence, the presence of toxic elements like Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb distinctly indicates the need to test such products to guarantee their quality and ensure consumer safety.",

But in the recent times, to avoid obesity and other health risks occurring due to their high calorie content, artificial sweeteners are replacing them rapidly. The FDA has approved utilisation of 5 artificial sweeteners namely, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, neotame and cyclamate. Alitame is still in the waiting list. The above-mentioned artificial sweeteners have no calories; theyare non-nutritive. They are poorly absorbed in the body attributing no changes in body weight gain. It has been noticed that synergism of two different classes of artificial sweeteners exhibit higher degree of sweetness in comparison to its individual components. This helps in masking the bitter or sour after taste of certain sweeteners. Since the discovery of the artificial sweeteners, the subject of their consumption is controversial owing to their effects on health ranging from mild headache to dreadful cancer risks. In spite of the daily consumption of artificial sweeteners in almost every foodstuff, the present studies demonstrate that artificial sweeteners are unhealthy. Artificial sweeteners should be consumed carefully and in limited quantities. Long term intake of artificial sweeteners above their ADI level is not recommended.Long term study of these sweeteners for further safety evaluation on health risks is essential. Further research is desirable to interpret the safety and metabolic effects of artificial sweeteners and better understand the possible consequence of these frequently used sweeteners on human health.In conclusion, to live a healthier life, it is best to use natural sweeteners or to consume artificial sweeteners taking into account its acceptable daily intake.",

While there are some short-term benefits associated with artificial sweeteners, such as reduced calorie intake and better blood sugar control, the evidence also highlights significant long-term health risks, including associations with various diseases and health hazards. The balance of evidence suggests that artificial sweeteners may not be definitively healthier than sugar, especially considering the potential for adverse health effects."

                "paragraph": "Ramadan fasting is a religious rite of Muslims which is also recognized as a form of intermittent fasting. More than 1.5 billion Muslims reportedly refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise (Sahur) to sunset (Iftar) during the holy month of Ramadan each year, which lasts between 28 and 30 days (1, 2), and thus practice intermittent fasting and caloric restriction. Intermittent fasting has been shown to have various beneficial health effects, including improved immune system function (3,4), enhanced cognitive function (5), improved body composition and reduced obesity (6,7), and even reduced episodes of seizures in some patients with epilepsy (8). However, the mechanisms mediating the effects of intermittent fasting remain largely obscure, which hamper the adoption of intermittent fasting as a strategy for improving health or as a disease intervention. Experiments in mice and clinical observations suggest that the benefits of intermittent fasting, such as positive effects on body weight and metabolism, can be explained by reduced energy intake (9). In addition, intermittent fasting regimens can influence metabolic regulation through changes in modifiable lifestyle behaviors, circadian rhythms, and gut microbiota (10). Our previous study has revealed that Ramadan fasting can significantly influence gut microbiota through dietary changes and has highlighted the enrichment of specific bacterial taxa, such as Sutterella and Parabacteroides, with implied health benefits in some individuals (11). \n\nGut microbiota have been described as a new metabolic organ that participates in regulating host metabolism (12,13). Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in metabolic levels can affect health status and are correlated with some diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes (14), pulmonary tuberculosis (15), obesity (16), epilepsy (17), and others. Recent studies have reported that both environmental and host factors, such as environmental contaminants (18), lifestyle (19), disease conditions (20), and drug use (21), could all influence gut metabolism. To explore the role of caloric restriction-induced microbiome changes in ischemic stroke rehabilitation, Huang et al. (22) applied metabolite profiling in a mouse model.",

                "abstract": "The human gut microbiota has been proposed to serve as a multifunctional organ in host metabolism, contributing effects to nutrient acquisition, immune response, and digestive health. Fasting during Ramadan may alter the composition of gut microbiota through changes in dietary behavior, which ultimately affects the contents of various metabolites in the gut. Here, we used liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the composition of fecal metabolites in Chinese and Pakistani individuals before and after Ramadan fasting. Principal component analysis showed distinct separation of metabolite profiles among ethnic groups as well as between pre- and post-fasting samples. After Ramadan fasting, the Chinese and Pakistani groups showed significant differences in their respective contents of various fecal metabolites. In particular, L-histidine, lycofawcine, and cordycepin concentrations were higher after Ramadan fasting in the Chinese group, while brucine was enriched in the Pakistani group. The KEGG analysis suggested that metabolites related to purine metabolism, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, and lysine degradation were significantly enriched in the total subject population pre-fasting vs. post-fasting comparisons. Several bacterial taxa were significantly correlated with specific metabolites unique to each ethnic group, suggesting that changes in fecal metabolite profiles related to Ramadan fasting may be influenced by associated shifts in gut microbiota. The fasting-related differences in fecal metabolite profile, together with these group-specific correlations between taxa and metabolites, support our previous findings that ethnic differences in dietary composition also drive variation in gut microbial composition and diversity. This landscape view of interconnected dietary behaviors, microbiota, and metabolites contributes to the future development of personalized, diet-based therapeutic strategies for gut-related disorders.",

In contrast, intermittent fasting requires deprivation of food on alternate days during the week. 12 he results of this revision corroborate other studies that evaluated the loss of bodyweight using intermittent fasting as a strategy. The authors showed that the loss varies from 2.5 to 9.9%, including the loss of associated body fat. These results are consequences of metabolic changes caused by fasting, which lead to an increase in lipolysis, proteolysis, and the depletion of glycogenolysis. 13 ccording to Azevedo et al., 14 the metabolic alterations are observed soon after the beginning of the fasting period. Plasma glucose levels fall and remain low during this period; lipolysis, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis increase while glycogenolysis decreases. \n\nThe increase in lipolysis and fat oxidation provides the substrate for gluconeogenesis and compensates for the decline in carbohydrate oxidation and glycogenolysis. This process also causes a moderate increase in proteolysis and protein oxidation. \n\nIntermittent Fasting also negatively regulates the expression in muscle tissue of mTOR, the gene responsible for modulating nutritional signaling, which decreases protein synthesis and increases the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1) in muscle tissue, as well as lipid oxidation. 14 hese metabolic processes lead to weight loss, as demonstrated by the results of two studies included in this review, but it is worth noting that these studies followed different protocols; the other two studies included had similar protocols showed no significant results. \n\nVarady et al. 4 supports intermittent fasting as an efficient dietary practice that can culminate in health benefits.

Strong evidence suggests that dairy consumption reduces the risk of colorectal cancer [76]. For example, a dose-response meta-analysis involving 14 studies found a 13% reduction in colorectal cancer risk for every 400-g increase in dairy consumption, controlling for BMI, physical activity, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, red meat, and menopausal hormone therapy [76]. In another meta-analysis involving 29 studies, consumption of total dairy products was associated with a reduced relative risk of developing colorectal cancer, however, specific dairy products including low-fat dairy, whole milk, fermented dairy, and cultured milk had no associations with colorectal cancer risk [77]. Pertaining to other cancers, studies have found high dairy consumption to increase the risk for prostate cancer, whereas data are inconclusive for other sites including breast, oral, and bladder cancers [76,78]. In conclusion, dairy products may only be protective against colorectal cancer risk, and further studies are warranted to determine whether consuming dairy products affects the risk of other cancers.",

This intake range is poorly investigated in previous studies, making it probably the only study to which our results could be well-compared. \n\nOur study did not observe any significant association of dairy consumption with risks of other site-specific cancers, including colorectal and prostate cancer. Existing evidence tends to support an inverse association of dairy intake with colorectal cancer risk and a positive association with prostate cancer risk [5][6][7]. However, large heterogeneity by geographic region was observed in previous studies on the topic [5] and no significant association was reported from China on either dairy consumption [17] or dairy calcium intake in relation to risks of these two types of cancers [41]. Despite the recent increase, the incidence of colorectal and prostate cancers is still lower in China than in the West [4,42,43]. Studies involving a larger number of cases (e.g. prolonged followup of CKB) are needed to confirm (or refute) any modest associations.",

                "abstract": "Previous studies of primarily Western populations have reported contrasting associations of dairy consumption with certain cancers, including a positive association with prostate cancer and inverse associations with colorectal and premenopausal breast cancers. However, there are limited data from China where cancer rates and levels of dairy consumption differ importantly from those in Western populations. The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank study recruited ~0.5 million adults from ten diverse (five urban, five rural) areas across China during 2004–2008. Consumption frequency of major food groups, including dairy products, was collected at baseline and subsequent resurveys, using a validated interviewer-administered laptop-based food frequency questionnaire. To quantify the linear association of dairy intake and cancer risk and to account for regression dilution bias, the mean usual consumption amount for each baseline group was estimated via combining the consumption level at both baseline and the second resurvey. During a mean follow-up of 10.8 (SD 2.0) years, 29,277 incident cancer cases were recorded among the 510,146 participants who were free of cancer at baseline. Cox regression analyses for incident cancers associated with usual dairy intake were stratified by age-at-risk, sex and region and adjusted for cancer family history, education, income, alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity, soy and fresh fruit intake, and body mass index. Overall, 20.4% of participants reported consuming dairy products (mainly milk) regularly (i.e. ≥1 day/week), with the estimated mean consumption of 80.8 g/day among regular consumers and of 37.9 g/day among all participants. There were significant positive associations of dairy consumption with risks of total and certain site-specific cancers, with adjusted HRs per 50 g/day usual consumption being 1.07 (95% CI 1.04–1.10), 1.12 (1.02–1.22), 1.19 (1.01–1.41) and 1.17 (1.07–1.29) for total cancer, liver cancer (n = 3191), female breast cancer (n = 2582) and lymphoma (n=915), respectively. However, the association with lymphoma was not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing. No significant associations were observed for colorectal cancer (n = 3350, 1.08 [1.00–1.17]) or other site-specific cancers. Among Chinese adults who had relatively lower dairy consumption than Western populations, higher dairy intake was associated with higher risks of liver cancer, female breast cancer and, possibly, lymphoma.",

After taking into account potential confounders, the inverse relationship persisted. \n\nA nonlinear dose-response relationship between lowfat dairy consumption and the risk of developing lung cancer was suggested by the restricted cubic spline plot. Subgroup analyses showed that increased low-fat dairy consumption might have greater benefits for lung cancer prevention in individuals with higher daily caloric intake. Additionally, the results were robust in sensitivity analyses, as they remained consistent after excluding participants who may have influenced the results. Numerous reports have recently focused on the link between dairy product intake and different types of cancer. Higher dairy milk consumption was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, according to a cohort study of 52,795 North American women who were followed up for 7.9 years. 8 Moreover, a prospective study of 28,737 participants demonstrated a 27% increased risk of prostate carcinoma in males with high dairy consumption in contrast to the ones with low dairy consumption. 24 According to a meta-analysis, there is a consistent inverse correlation between dairy consumption and the risk of developing prostate cancer. 25 In contrast, according to a prospective observational study, increased dairy consumption significantly reduced the risk of developing colorectal cancer by up to 45% among older Mediterranean individuals. 26 The positive effect of dairy products on colorectal carcinoma prevention has also been demonstrated elsewhere. 10,27 urthermore, a pooled analysis published in 2020 showed that participants with high yogurt consumption had a 19% lower lung cancer risk compared to no yogurt consumers. 9 However, no link was found between milk, dairy consumption, and the risk of developing lung cancer. 10,28 hese contradictory results could create confusion about whether dairy product consumption should be increased or decreased to minimize cancer risk. These inconsistencies may be attributed to the fact that dairy products are a complex and diverse food group, and previous researchers have failed to consider the effect of different fat contents and types of dairy products on the outcomes. To our knowledge, there has not been any published study that has investigated the link between consuming low-fat dairy and lung cancer risk.",

It is estimated that diet accounts for 35% of all cancer risk. 6 Milk and dairy products from various animal sources are considered well-balanced nutritive foods, 7 and dietary guidelines recommend a daily consumption of low-fat dairy products for optimal health. 8 Recently, however, the assumed beneficial effects of dairy consumption have been questioned and potential risks have been identified by nutrition scientists 9 strengths and limitations of this study ► To the best of our knowledge, this is the first overview of reviews to synthesise current evidence from pooled analyses/meta-analyses and systematic reviews (PMASRs) that evaluated associations between dairy consumption and development of incident cancer and/or mortality. ► Comprehensive search strategy and a systematic review methodology. ► An a priori protocol registered in Prospective\n\nRegister of Systematic Reviews. ► Only included English-language PMASRs. ► Marked heterogeneity among included PMASRs with respect to study design and methodological quality of included studies limits ability to reach valid conclusions regarding associations or causal inferences.

Design Overview of reviews. Setting Community setting. Participants The unit of analysis is PMASRs. A total of 42 PMASRs was included in this overview of reviews. Interventions/exposures Any dairy product consumption (eg, milk, yogurt, etc). Primary and secondary outcomes measures Primary outcome measure is development of any type of cancer. Secondary outcome measures are all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Results From 9693 citations identified, we included 42 PMASRs (52 study reports) published between 1991 and 2017. Thirty-one (74%) of these was pooled analyses/meta analyses, and only 11 (26%) were systematic reviews and meta-analyses. There was a wide variability in the type of study designs included within the other PMASRs, thus contributing to variable and, in instances, divergent estimates of cancer risk for several cancer subtypes. For example, only one systematic review and meta-analysis exclusively included prospective study designs. Most PMASRs were of low to moderate quality based on the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scores. The median AMSTAR score was 5 (IQR 2–7). Our overview identified conflicting evidence from PMASRs on association between dairy consumption and incident cancers or mortality. Heterogeneity in summary estimates reflected the inclusion of variable study designs and overall low methodological quality of individual PMASRs. Conclusions The association between dairy consumption and cancer risk has been explored in PMASRs with a variety of study designs and of low to moderate quality. To fully characterise valid associations between dairy consumption and risk of cancer and/or mortality rigorously conducted, PMASRs including only high-quality prospective study designs are required.

Before discussing the potential effects of small and micro water systems projects, it is important to briefly examine the main findings of experiments conducted by scientists. Although environmental impacts are expected to be smaller and different in smaller systems (Egré and Milewski, 2002;Abbasi and Abbasi, 2011;Başkaya et al., 2011). \n\nHydroelectric energy production projects have been extensively studied alongside thermal units in terms of their environmental impacts. While some experts believe that hydroelectric units, particularly large ones, have negative effects on the environment and have the greatest destructive impact compared to other renewable energy sources, there is not a complete consensus. In the 1950s, when only a few of these units were in use worldwide, it was believed that this energy source was the cleanest form of energy compared to other sources. Water is one of the most expensive and even the most expensive natural resource, and dams provide this water in abundant quantities and in a way that can be used several times. Dams provide the possibility of water use throughout the year (for public use, fishing, and recreation). After electricity is obtained from water, it can be used for irrigating agricultural lands downstream of the dam. During this process, it is possible to recharge underground water resources. This energy and these benefits will be obtained without creating any smoke from thermal units or any hazardous waste from nuclear power plants (Jumani et al., 2017;Nautiyal and Goel, 2020;Oladosu et al., 2021). However, now, after 50 years, such units are considered hazardous by some experts. The most important environmental effects caused by large hydroelectric units are storing rainfall in the area, creating an artificial lake, reducing water flow downstream, and changing the flow of the river. Changes in the water flow can have various environmental effects, including increased water evaporation and potential soil leakage, displacement of small aquatic organisms, formation of distinct temperature layers, alterations in habitat and food availability, and reduction of inhabitable lands due to the creation of artificial lakes. Moreover, there is a risk of nutrient accumulation in the lake area and downstream river regions. Organisms located at river mouths may experience negative impacts due to the mixing of saltwater and the diminished flow of freshwater.",

                "paragraph": "Global warming has been indisputable over the last century due to the impact of human activities, and model projections indicate that it may rise by 1.1 to 5.4 °C by 2100, depending on various greenhouse gas emission scenarios [1]. This increase in surface temperature has resulted in numerous adverse effects, including rising sea levels and melting glaciers that cause flooding and droughts, changes in precipitation patterns leading to extreme weather events, and negative impacts on agriculture and biodiversity [2]. These effects threaten the health and stability of ecosystems and communities that rely on them for their livelihoods. As people begin to recognize the detrimental repercussions of global warming, there is a wave of desire for alternative energy sources, particularly the \"renewable\". Even prior to the acceptance of global warming as a reality in the postmodern era, fossil fuels were nearly widely considered as highly \"dirty\" fuels responsible for several forms of terrible pollution, including acid rain. In contrast, nonconventional energy sources, particularly the renewable energy sources, have enjoyed a \"clean\" reputation vis-à-vis environmental repercussion [3]. \n\nThere are numerous renewable energy sources, with hydropower being one of the most notable [4]. \n\nHydroelectric energy is usually produced by dams and hydropower plants situated near reservoirs and rivers. Reservoir hydropower plants utilize water stored in a reservoir, whereas run-of-river hydropower plants harvest electricity from the river's natural flow [5]. A typical hydroelectric power plant consists of three parts: an electric plant that generates power, a dam that can control water flow by opening and closing, and a reservoir that stores water. Water from the reservoir runs through an intake and exerts pressure on the turbine blades, causing them to rotate. To produce electricity, the turbine spins a generator. The amount of electricity produced, which depends on the water flow rate and the distance the water falls, can be transmitted over longdistance power lines to power homes, factories, and businesses. As reported by the International Energy Agency, hydropower contributed 16.1% to global electricity generation in 2019, and it was expected to remain a significant source of electricity worldwide in the future [6]. The construction of hydroelectric dams, however, has the potential to kill or disrupt animals and other natural resources.",

Hydropower, in particular, has emerged as a prominent and extensively developed source of renewable energy in recent decades. This specific renewable energy harnesses the kinetic energy of falling or fast-flowing water to generate electricity. Despite being a dependable, adaptable, and cost-effective energy source, previous studies have highlighted the detrimental ecological effects of hydropower, ranging from altered land use to the disruption of natural habitats in the vicinity of dams. The main purpose of this study is two-fold. First, the change of renewable energy, particularly hydropower, is evaluated from 2000 to 2020 in China and globally, highlighting the leading role of hydropower in renewable energy generation. Second, this study aims to investigate the environmental influences of large hydroelectric dam construction and perform a case study of the Three Gorges Dam in China. The Pearson's linear correlation analysis was utilized to identify the association between hydropower and climate, and biodiversity, individually. Although dam construction can boost hydroelectricity generation, it can also have adverse effects on the regional climate and result in substantial depletion of biodiversity. This study will shed light on potentially reliable strategies to optimize the advantages of hydropower and minimize the negative environmental impacts of large-scale dam construction.",

                "paragraph": "Whereas 28% of electricity is generated from hydro schemes (rivers, dams, ocean waves and tides), wind, solar and geothermal power plants which are considered as clean energy sources and consequently produces practically no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions and so are good for sustaining clean environment [9]. In addition to pollution aspects, all forms of energy sources used for power generation, may be subjected to accidental systems failure which can be as much dangerous to environment. This becomes quite obvious, since modern energy systems use materials that are combustible (gasoline), explosive (LNG), toxic (fumes), radioactive (enriched uranium fuel), and mechanical stress failure (hydroelectric dams), thus, causing environmental hostilities. Such systems, thereby, might be subject to explosions, fires, structural collapses and meltdowns, floods, contaminations, and other tragic events, resulting in loss of lives, shatter families & communities, and cause immense property damage. \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [11], is the largest worldwide scientific establishment, which has deep concern about electricity and its environmental affects, reported that \"All forms of electricity generation have some level of environmental impact, in that it produces more pollution than any other single industry. Fossil fuel power plants produce environmental problems on land & water, such as air emissions, thermal releases, solid waste disposal, ash disposal coal, and noise. On the other hand, nuclear power plants have one environmental issue no other form of electrical power plant does. An accident at a nuclear power plant may release large amounts of radioactive particles, resulting in a direct loss of life, and rendering a large land area immediately around the plant unlivable. In contrast, electricity from renewable resources generally does not contribute to local air pollution since no fuels are combusted in these processes, thus environmental problems are at a minimum. Specific interest is hydro plants which may help with flood control, flow regulation, or reservoir recreational projects. However, many things in hydropower plant can go wrong due to various reasons such as for example, dam collapse, penstock rapture, and turbine failure, as well as, risks to workers and public may also arise during dam construction [12,13]. \n\nThe above and similar published literatures have concentrated on a descriptive and statistical safety rating related to one kind of energy source.",

For many regions, this demand has been met with thermoelectric facilities and fossil fuels, but many of the world's tropical regions have turned to hydropower to generate and supply the energy they need [1]. Hydroelectric dams represent major investments that do not come without controversial public opinion about their social and environmental impacts [2]. Hydropower offers a reliable source of domestically-produced electricity, yet comprehensive assessments that help minimise the environmental and social impacts that these dams cause are rare, often constrained by the limited availability of information and conflicts of interest, despite efforts from the World Commission on Dams to promote better strategic assessments [1]. Most studies that measure the impacts of hydroelectric dams focus on their environmental impacts and on their effects on the livelihoods of riverine communities and displaced population-while largely ignoring how these dams affect the livelihoods of rural agricultural households. This paper will focus on these impacts to contribute to how hydropower dams affect a variety of stakeholder populations. \n\nThe complex environmental impacts caused by the construction and operation of large dams cannot be overstated. In order to build a large dam, an extensive area needs to be flooded in order to create the reservoir, resulting in deforestation at the site, which in turn stimulates the deforestation of surrounding areas [3][4][5]. Deforestation depletes soils of important minerals, and exposes them to rapid degradation, while the ecosystem services that rainforests provide are many, such as the continuous recycling of carbon dioxide into oxygen, the retention and sequestration of carbon, and the preservation of biodiversity. The effects of deforestation are particularly relevant in the Amazon region, which is the largest extant rainforest. Additional impacts include the manipulation of river flows, and while upstream from the dam land will be vulnerable to waterlogging, downstream land will see a drastic decrease in the flow and quantity of water. Fisheries will suffer as the migration trajectories of fish are blocked by the dam, and the water level of the river decreases downstream [6]. \n\nWhen likely losers from the construction of a dam are identified, efforts to compensate them may not always successful.",

Hydropower is an important energy policy issue in Brazil, and it is promoted as the preferred electricity option, because it is the least expensive in terms of long-term returns on investment; the Belo Monte dam in Northern Brazil provides an opportunity to study the effects of large investments in hydroelectric infrastructure on the surrounding local population. Using a matched panel data spanning 10 years (2005 to 2015), we study the impacts of Brazil’s Belo Monte dam on cocoa and other food crop producers in the region. We find that households have seen a decline in rural employment opportunities, and despite improvements in cocoa productivity households have experienced declining food production. With the construction of the dam largely completed, farmers must now face the challenges of decreased food access and shifts in employment opportunities, and while there are many advantages and opportunities associated with this new development, special policy considerations are necessary to ensure that there are safety nets in place to assist those who will see a decline in access to economic opportunities.",

Human actions such as electricity generation are contributory causes of climate change. In a quest to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases associated with electricity generation from fossil fuels, the world is turning to renewables. Renewable sources, however, also do have an impact on the environment. Likewise, renewable electricity generation is also dependent on the climate. Hydro, Wind, and Solar are the popular renewable energy sources for the generation of electricity. This work reviews the impact of these renewables in electricity generation on the environment. It also considers the effect of climate change on its use. The construction of renewable electricity generating plants leads to habitat disruptions and can also cause fatalities. Climate change weighs an enormous impact on the performance of renewable electricity generating plants. The recent blackout experienced in Texas as a result of the cold weather is a good example. The end of extreme weather conditions is not yet, and the need to start preparing to prevent a blackout re-occurrence. A possible solution for sustainable renewable electricity generation in extreme weather conditions lies in synthetic fuel availability. A R T I C L E I N F O Handling editor: Muhsin J. Jweeg",

                "paragraph": "Obesity is a multifaceted disease, and its etiology remains widely misunderstood. Weight gain has primarily been blamed on high calorie diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Many types of fad diets have shown short-lived improvements in body weight, but the overall success for long-term weight loss through caloric restriction remains inefficacious and the global prevalence of obesity continues to rise. Recent research has highlighted the shortcomings of the energy balance, or \"calories in versus calories out\" paradigm of weight management. The idea that people must consume less calories than they burn in order to lose weight is self-evident, but is no longer an all-inclusive explanation for the increasing rate of obesity and long-term weight gain. \n\nSome lower income countries have reported a decrease in exercise, other higher income countries, such as the U.S., have reported a consistent or even increased level of exercise over the last 30 years despite the continuous rise in obesity (12,13). If the population is gaining weight despite recommended physical activity levels, then the problem must also include the nature of the foods ingested as well as energy expenditure. We must consider the quality of the calorie being consumed since not all calories are created equal. The quality of the calorie, and whether it is coming from healthy foods or unhealthy foods, influences the types of food we should and shouldn't eat and how our bodies metabolize those calories for maximal benefit. Primates who were given calorically equal meals that only differed in the percentage of cis or trans-fats showed a disparity in weight gain after six years, with the trans-fat group showing an increase in visceral fat (14). The composition of our diets, more so than the caloric count of our daily diets, affects hormonal imbalances, metabolic efficiency, epigenetics, gut health, and fat accumulation (15). According to the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity, the way we metabolize processed carbohydrates and foods that are higher on the glycemic index (such as starchy, refined, and sugary foods) promotes fat storage in fat cells and is driven by spikes in insulin levels (16).",

                "abstract": "Adult and childhood obesity have reached pandemic level proportions. The idea that caloric excess and insufficient levels of physical activity leads to obesity is a commonly accepted answer for unwanted weight gain. This paradigm offers an inconclusive explanation as the world continually moves towards an unhealthier and heavier existence irrespective of energy balance. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals that resemble natural hormones and disrupt endocrine function by interfering with the body’s endogenous hormones. A subset of EDCs called obesogens have been found to cause metabolic disruptions such as increased fat storage, in vivo. Obesogens act on the metabolic system through multiple avenues and have been found to affect the homeostasis of a variety of systems such as the gut microbiome and adipose tissue functioning. Obesogenic compounds have been shown to cause metabolic disturbances later in life that can even pass into multiple future generations, post exposure. The rising rates of obesity and related metabolic disease are demanding increasing attention on chemical screening efforts and worldwide preventative strategies to keep the public and future generations safe. This review addresses the most current findings on known obesogens and their effects on the metabolic system, the mechanisms of action through which they act upon, and the screening efforts through which they were identified with. The interplay between obesogens, brown adipose tissue, and the gut microbiome are major topics that will be covered.",

                "paragraph": "Obesity increases a person's risk for developing chronic health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke (1). Because most US adults are overweight or obese (2), weight management is essential for chronic disease prevention. Dramatic increases in the prevalence of obesity in the past 25 years are attributed to an environment that promotes excessive calorie intake, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle (3). Eating in restaurants contributes to this excess intake; Americans are 40% more likely to eat out at least 3 times per week now than they were in the 1980s (4), often eating large portions of calorie-dense foods (3). \n\nFrequency of restaurant eating is positively associated with calorie and fat intake, along with body fat (3)(4)(5)(6). Other studies show positive associations between frequency of eating fast food and body mass index (7)(8). Little is known, however, about how restaurant eating affects weight management. We conducted a Medline search and found no studies that specifically addressed strategies used to manage weight or barriers to weight management when eating out. Studies have found that several factors influence restaurant eating behavior: taste, portion size, emotional needs, perceived value, and social interaction (9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). These factors are often barriers to weight management when eating out. \n\nThe main objective of this study was to describe how often women and men use different strategies for managing weight when eating out (including fast food) and the magnitude of barriers to managing weight when eating out. Because sex differences occur in food choices and weight management behaviors (18)(19)(20), a secondary objective was to explore sex differences in the specific strategies used and the barriers encountered to increase our understanding of weight management in restaurant settings.",

Methods We recruited a convenience sample of 146 adults at a university open house. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics and eating patterns, strategies used to manage weight in restaurants, and barriers to managing weight in restaurants. Results The most common strategies used by participants were avoiding sugar-filled drinks, choosing steamed vegetables and whole-grain foods, and stopping eating when full. We found few differences by sex: women were more likely to share appetizers or meals, substitute appetizers for meals, have salads as entrées, order salad dressing on the side, and bring half of the meal home. Conclusion Women and men had more similarities than differences in strategies for and barriers to managing weight in restaurants. We need to understand what influences food choices at restaurants in order to develop comprehensive plans for weight management.",

National policy guidelines indicate that general practice is best suited to deliver obesity healthcare, however, obesity rates continue to rise worldwide indicating interventions are ineffective in this space. The aim of this study was to explore the weight management experiences from patient perspectives. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with 16 rural Waikato general practice patients. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: Inconsistent Information, Significance of Holistic Factors, Obesity Centre Need, and Education. Participants expressed frustration at contradictory health messages, commercial company and ‘expert’ definition distrust, and that ‘holistic’ aspects to health significant to the weight management journey were unable to be addressed in general practice. Conclusion Whilst primary care is positioned as suitable for delivering obesity healthcare, this study found that participants do not perceive general practice to be equipped to deliver this care. Instead, participants argued for a specialist obesity centre capable of meeting all their obesity healthcare needs. Further, wider issues including on-line commodification of health and neo-liberal capitalism - factors that exploit people with a stigmatised health issue - can cause further harm to the participant. A radical modernisation of education, information, and resources from regulated, qualified and ‘trusted’ healthcare professionals who can provide safe, non-stigmatising supportive services is recommended to meet the unique and changing food climate, reduce obesity rates and improve health outcomes.",

                "paragraph": "In recent years, efforts to understand the obesity crisis have focused attention on measuring and understanding the role of the \"built environment\" (i.e., the physical surroundings that may impact dietary intake or energy expenditure, including homes [1]). Many experts now agree that the built environment must be considered in any effort to understand or reduce obesity [2]. Research has begun emerging on possible associations between the home food environment and food intake [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Studies have found a relationship between number of high-fat foods in the home and fat intake [5] and fruit and vegetable availability in the home and intake of these foods among adolescents [4,6,7]. Understanding home food availability is crucial in fully grasping overall patterns of dietary intake, as Nielsen and colleagues [9] estimated that 65% of all calories were consumed in the home. \n\nFew studies, however, have examined the impact of a behavioral weight control program on the home food environment of adults [10,11], and no studies have examined whether home environment characteristics change over the course of a weight control program in distinct ways for different race groups or in different regions. Ample evidence exists to document differential response to weight loss programs by race [12][13][14][15], with African Americans tending to lose less weight than white participants. There is also some suggestion that individuals from different regions of the United States may respond differently to similar weight loss programs, due to higher initial body weight [16,17] or greater initial dietary fat intake [18,19]. \n\nChanges in availability of higher fat foods in the home and food storage practices may be important for supporting weight management efforts. Targeting fat intake in addition to overall caloric intake in a behavioral weight control program is strongly supported by studies [20,21] that demonstrate when fat and calories are both controlled, weight loss is improved. Furthermore, some initial evidence suggests an association between successful weight loss and significant changes in the home food environment [10]. Such changes in the food environment within the home may even facilitate weight loss among individuals in the household who are not directly engaged in a weight control intervention program [10].",

Participants were weighed and completed measures of household food availability and food storage practices at baseline and post-treatment. We examined baseline differences and changes in high-fat food availability, low-fat food availability and the storage of foods in easily visible locations, overall and by race (African American or white participants) and region (Arkansas or Vermont).ResultsAt post-treatment, the sample as a whole reported storing significantly fewer foods in visible locations around the house (-0.5 ± 2.3 foods), with no significant group differences. Both Arkansas African Americans (-1.8 ± 2.4 foods) and Arkansas white participants (-1.8 ± 2.6 foods) reported significantly greater reductions in the mean number of high-fat food items available in their homes post-treatment compared to Vermont white participants (-0.5 ± 1.3 foods), likely reflecting fewer high-fat foods reported in Vermont households at baseline. Arkansas African Americans lost significantly less weight (-3.6 ± 4.1 kg) than Vermont white participants (-8.3 ± 6.8 kg), while Arkansas white participants did not differ significantly from either group in weight loss (-6.2 ± 6.0 kg).
