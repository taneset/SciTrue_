Although there is a substantial number of studies supporting the presumed negative link between diversity and social cohesion, to the extent that it appears to become an “empirical regularity” (van der Meer and Tolsma, 2014, p. 471), there are also studies contradicting this association (see Portes and Vickstrom 2011; Schaeffer, 2013b). In their review, van der Meer and Tolsma (2014) indeed find a positive link between ethnic heterogeneity and trust between members of different ethnic groups.

Mitigation strategies (which include both the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (CDR)) must remain the policy focus, as they are the only means for addressing the root cause of climate change. However, it may be extremely difficult to meet the global warming temperature goals of 1.5 or 2°C stipulated in the Paris Agreement on climate with mitigation alone. Further, as CO2 (the primary driver of current climate change) has a long lifetime in the atmosphere, CO2 and temperatures are likely to remain elevated for hundreds of years in the absence of net-negative emissions. Adaptation may help reduce risks associated with a particular level of warming but is limited in its effectiveness and sustainability.

As concerns grow over the effectiveness of reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone to combat global warming, SRM strategies have emerged as potential countermeasures. These strategies may either limit the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface or enhance the reflection of sunlight back into space, both of which aim to reduce solar heating. Two primary approaches within SRM include albedo modification, which involves increasing the Earth's reflectivity, and solar irradiation mitigation, which focuses on reducing sunlight absorption. Methods for albedo modification may include cloud seeding or even painting surfaces white to reflect more sunlight. Conversely, strategies for solar irradiation mitigation could involve injecting particles into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions. Despite its potential, SRM has garnered criticism for its high costs, the necessity for international cooperation, and the risk of unintended ecological consequences. Additionally, many experts caution that while SRM may provide temporary relief from climate change, it does not address the core issue of greenhouse gas concentrations. As such, proponents advocate for SRM to be part of a broader, multifaceted approach to tackle climate change effectively.",
